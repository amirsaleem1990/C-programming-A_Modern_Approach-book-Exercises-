7.3  Character Types 135

to a 256-character code known as Latin-1 thai provides the characters necessary
for Western European and many African languages.

 

m es

 

A variable of type char can be assigned any single character:

char ch;

ch = 'a'; /* lower-case a */
ch = 'A'; /* upper-case A */
ch = '0'; /* zero * /
ch = !" "; /* space */

Notice that character constants are enclosed in single quotes, not double quotes.

Operations on Characters

Working with characters in C is simple. because of one fact: C treats characters as
small integers. After all, characters are encoded in binary, and it doesn't take much
imagination to view these binary codes as integers. In ASCIL, for example, charac-
ter codes range from 0000000 to 1111111, which we can think of as the integers
from O to 127. The character ' a' has the value 97, " A* has the value 65, " O' has
the value 48, and " " has the value 32. The connection between characters and
integers in C is so strong that character constants actually have int type rather
than char type (an interesting fact, but not one that will often matter to us).

When a character appears in a computation, C simply uses its integer value.
Consider the following examples, which assume the ASCHI character set:

char ch;

int i;

i = 'a'; /* i is now 97 */
ch = 65; /* ch is now 'A' */
ch = ch + 1; /* ch is now 'B' */
ch++; /* ch is now 'C' */

Characters can be compared, just as numbers can. The following i £ statement
checks whether ch contains a lower-case letter; if so, it converts ch to upper case.

if a' < ch & ch <= 'z!)

( ;
ch ch - ‘'a' + 'A';

Comparisons such as 'a' <= ch are done using the integer values of the charac-
ters involved. These values depend on the character set in use, so programs that use
<, <=, >, and >= to compare characters may not be portable.

The fact that characters have the same properties as numbers has some advan-
tages. For example. we can easily write a for statement whose control variable
steps through all the upper-case letters:

for (ch = 'A!'; ch <= 'Z'; ch++)
