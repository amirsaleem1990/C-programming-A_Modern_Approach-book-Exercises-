Write a program that asks the user to enter a fraction. then reduces the fraction to lowest
terms:

Enter a fraction: 6/12
In lowest terms: 1/2

 

Hint: To reduce a fraction to lowest terms. first compute the GCD of the numerator and
denominator. Then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

Add a toop to the broker .c program of Section 5.2 so that the user can enter more than
one trade and the program will calculate the commission on each. The program should ter-
minate when the user enters O as the trade value:

Enter value of trade: 30000
Commission: S166.00

Enter value of trade: 20000
Commission: $144.00

Enter value of trade: O

Programming Project | in Chapter 4 asked you to write a program that displays a two-digit
number with its digits reversed. Generalize the program so that the number can have one,
two, three, or more digits. Hinr: Use a do loop that repeatedly divides the number by 10,
stopping when it reaches O.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number n. then prints all even squares
between | and n. For example, if the user enters 100, the program should print the follow-

ing:
4
16
36

64
100

Rearrange the square3 .c program so that the £or loop initializes i, tests i, and incre-
ments i. Don't rewrite the program; in particular, don’t use any multiplications.

Write a program that prints a one-month calendar. The user specifies the number of days in
the month and the day of the week on which the month begins:

Enter number of days in month: 31
Enter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3

1 2 3 & 5

6 7 8 S 10 11 12

13 14 15 16 17 18 19

20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 29 30 31

Hint: This program isn’t as hard as it looks. The most important part is a for statement that
uses a variable i to count from ! to n, where n is the number of days in the month, printing
each value of i. Inside the loop, an i £ statement tests whether i is the last day in a week: if
so. 1t prints a new-line character.

Programming Project 8 in Chapter 2 asked you to write a program that calculates the
remaining balance on à loan after the first, second, and third monthly payments. Modify the
program so that it also asks the user to enter the number of payments and then displays the
balance remaining after each of these payments.
