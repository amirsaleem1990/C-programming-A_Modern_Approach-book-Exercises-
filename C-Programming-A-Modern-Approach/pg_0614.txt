Library Support for Numbers
and Character Data

Prolonged contact with the computer turns
mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.

This chapter describes the five most important library headers that provide support

for working with numbers, characters, and character strings. Sections 23.1 and

23.2 cover the <float .h> and <limits.h> headers, which contain macros
describing the characteristics of numeric and character types. Sections 23.3 and
23.4 describe the <math. h> header, which provides mathematical functions. Sec-
tion 23.3 discusses the C89 version of <math.h>: Section 23.4 covers the C99
additions, which are so extensive that l’ve chosen to cover them separately. Sec-
tions 23.5 and 23.6 are devoted to the <ctype.h> and <string.h> headers,
which provide character functions and string functions, respectively.

C99 adds several headers that also deal with numbers, characters, and strines.
The <wchar .h> and <wctype .h> headers are discussed in Chapter 25. Chap-
ter 27 covers <complex.h>, <fenv.h>, <inttypes.h>, <stdint.h>,
and <tgmath.h»>.

The <float.h> Header: Characteristics of
Floating Types

The <float .h> header provides macros that define the range and accuracy of
the float, double, and 1long double types. There are no types or functions
in cfloat.h»>.

Two macros apply to all floating types. The FLT ROUNDS macro represents
the current rounding direction for floating-point addition. Table 23.1 shows the
possible values of FLT ROUNDS. (Values not shown in the table indicate imple-
mentation-defined rounding behavior.)
