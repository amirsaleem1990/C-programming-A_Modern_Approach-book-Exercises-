Balancing a Checkbook

Many simple interactive programs are menu-based: they present the user with a list
of commands to choose from. Once the user has selected a command. the program
performs the desired action, then prompts the user For another command. This pro-
cess continues until the user selects an “exit” or “quit” command.

The heart of such a program will obviously be a loop. Inside the loop will be
statements that prompt the user for a command, read the command, then decide
what action to take:

for (;;) |
prompt user to enter command ;
read command ;
execute command ;

}

Executing the command will require a switch statement (or cascaded i £ state-
ment):

for (;;) {
prompt user to enter command ;
read command ;
switch (connnand) {
case command,: perform operation,; break;
