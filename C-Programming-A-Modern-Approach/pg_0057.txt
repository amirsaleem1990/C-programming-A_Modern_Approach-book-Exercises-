In any event, there’s a better way to disable portions of a program, as we’ll see
later.

Where does the £loat type get its name? [p. 17]

float 1s short for “floating-point.” a technique for storing numbers in which the
decimal point “floats.”” À float value 1s usually stored in two parts: the fraction
(or mantissa) and the exponent. The number 12.0 might be stored as 1.5 x 2°, for
example, where 1.5 1s the fraction and 3 1s the exponent. Some programming lan-
guages call this type real instead of float.

 

How many spaces should I use for indentation? [p. 28]

That’s a tough question. Leave too little space, and the eye has trouble detecting
indentation. Leave too much, and lines run off the screen (or page). Many C pro-
grammers indent nested statements eight spaces (one tab stop), which 1s probably
too much. Studies have shown that the optimum amount of indentation 1s three
spaces, but many programmers feel uncomfortable with numbers that aren°t a
power of two. Although ! normally préfer to indent three or four spaces, l’Il use
two spaces in this book so that my programs will fit within the margins.
