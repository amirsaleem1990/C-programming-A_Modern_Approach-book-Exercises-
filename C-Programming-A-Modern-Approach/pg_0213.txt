188 Chapter9 Functions

æ

 

After the function name comes a list of parameters. Each parameter is pre-
ceded by a specification of its type; parameters are separated by commas. If the
function has no parameters. the word void should appear between the parenthe-

ses. Note: À separate type must be specified for each parameter. even when several
parameters have the same type:

double average (double a, b) /*** WRONG ***/

{

return (a + b) / 2;

}

The body of a function may include both declarations and statements. For
example, the average function could be written

double average (double a, double b)

{
double sum: /* declaration */
sum = a + b; /* statement */
return sum / 2; /* statement */

;
