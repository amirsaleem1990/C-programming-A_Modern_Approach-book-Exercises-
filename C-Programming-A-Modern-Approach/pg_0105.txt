80 Chapter5  Selection Statements

 

   

We'1l often need to test a series of conditions, stopping as soon as one of them is
true. À “cascaded” i£ statement is often the best way to write such a series of
tests. For example, the following cascaded if statement tests whether n is less
than O, equal to O. or greater than 0:

if (n < O)
printf("n is less than O\n") ;
else
if (n == O)
printf ("n is equal to O\n") ;
else

print£("n is greater than O\n") ;

Although the second i £ statement is nested inside the first, C programmers don*t
usually indent it. Instead, they align each e1se with the original i f:

 

Lf ( expression )
statement

else 1£ ( expression )
statement

else if ( expression )
statement

else
statement
