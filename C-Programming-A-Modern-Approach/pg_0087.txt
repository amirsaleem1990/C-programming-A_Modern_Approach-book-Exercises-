The - - operator has similar properties:

l = 1;
print£ ("i is sd\n", --i); /* prints "i is O" */
printf("i is %“d\n", i); /* prints "i is O" */
i = 1;
printf ("i is $d\n", i--); /* prints "i is 1" */
print£("i is $d\n", i); /* prints "i is O" */
When ++ or -- is used more than once in the same expression, the result can

often be hard to understand. Consider the following statements:

l = 1;

j = 27

k = ++i + j++;

What are the values of i, , and k after these statements are executed? Since ài is

incremented before its value is used, but j is incremented afrer it is used, the last
statement 1s equivalent to

i =

Ci. H- }.J.
+ ++
pu. #

j =

/

so the final values of i, j, and k are 2, 3, and 4, respectively, In contrast, executing
the statements

i = 1;
j = 27
K = i++ + j++;

will give i, j, and k the values 2, 3, and 3, respectively.
