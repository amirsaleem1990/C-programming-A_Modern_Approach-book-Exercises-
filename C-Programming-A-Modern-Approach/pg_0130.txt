We now come to the last of C’s loops: the For statement. Don’t be discouraged by
the for statement’s apparent complexity; it’s actually the best way to write many
loops. The £or statement is idcal for loops that have a “countine” variable, but it’s
versatile enough to be used for other kinds of loops as well.

When this £or statement is executed, the variable i is initialized to 10, then i is
tested to see if it’s greater than O. Since it is, the message T minus 10 and
