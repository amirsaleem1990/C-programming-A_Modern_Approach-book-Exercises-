2.1 Writing a Simple Program 11

Fortunately, this process is often automated, so you won't find it too onerous. In
fact, the preprocessor is usually integrated with the compiler, so you probably
won't even notice it at work.

The commands necessary to compile and link vary, depending on the compiler
and operating system. Under UNIX, the C compiler 1s usually named cc. To com-
pile and link the pun. c program, enter the following command in a terminal or
command-line window:

©

% cc pun.c

(The % character 1s the UNIX prompt, not something that you need to enter.) Üi{1k—
ing 1s automatic when using CC: no separate link command ts necessary.

After compiling and linking the program, cc leaves the executable program in
a file named a.out by default. cc has many options; one of them (the -o option)
allows us to choose the name of the file containing the executable program. For
example, if we want the executable version of pun. c Lo be named pun, we would
enter the following command:

oe

CC -O Pull pun.c
