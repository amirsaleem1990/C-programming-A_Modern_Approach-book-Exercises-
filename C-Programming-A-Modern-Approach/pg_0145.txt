Q: Does the null statement have any uses besides indicating that the body of a
loop is empty? [p. 116]

A:  Very few. Since the null statement can appear wherever a statement is allowed,
there are many potential uses for the null statement. In practice. however, there’s
only one other use of the null statement, and it’s rare.

Suppose that we need to put a label at the end of a compound statement. A
label can’t stand alone: it must always be followed by a statement. Puttins a null
statement after the label solves the problem:

{

goto end of stmt;

end _of stmt: ;

}

Q:  Are there any other ways to make an empty loop body stand out besides put-
ting the null statement on a line by itself? [p. 1171

À: _ Some programmers use a dummy continue statement:

for (d = 2; d < n & n % d != 0O0; d++)
continue ;

Others use an empty compound statement:

for (d = 2; d<n& n %d'!= 0; d++)
