Chapter 3  Formatted Input/Ouiput

3.2

 

 

Forgetting to put the & symbol in front of a variable in à call of scan£ will have
unpredictable—and possibly disastrous—results. À program crash 1s a common
outcome. Ât the very least, the value that ts read from the input won't be stored in
the variable: instead, the variable will retain its old value (which may be meaning-
less if the variable wasn°’t given an initial value). Omitting the & is an extremely
common error—be careful! Some compilers can spot this error and produce a
warning message such as “format argument is not a pointer.” (The term pointer is
defined in Chapter 11; the & symbol is used to create à pointer to à variable.) IF you
get a warning, check for a missing &.
