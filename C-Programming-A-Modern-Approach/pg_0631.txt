(a domain error occurs). cbrt, on the other hand, is defined for both positive and
negative arguments. When its argument is negative, cbrt returns a negative result.

When applied to arguments x and y, the hypot function returns /x? + y2. In
other words, this function computes the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs x
and y.

Error and Gamma Functions

double erf (double x) ;
float erff(float x);
long double erf1(long double x) ;

double erfc (double x) ;
float erfcf (float x);
long double erfcl(long double x);

double l1gamma (double x) ;
float lgammaf (float x);
long double 1gammal (long double x) ;

double tgamnma (double x) ;
float tgammaf (float x) ;
long double tgammal (long double x);

The er£ function computes the error function erf (also known as the Gaussian
error function), which is used in probability, statistics and partial differential
equations. The mathematical definition of erf is

erf(x) = ÀJ.‘e-'zdt
JT “
erfc computes the complementary error function, erfc(x) = | — erf(x).

The gamma function T is an extension of the factorial function that can be
applied to real numbers as well as to integers. When applied to an integer n, T(n) =
(n—1)!; the definition of P for nonintegers is more complicated. The tgamma func-
tion computes l'. The 1gamma function computes In(IT(x)l), the natural logarithm
of the absolute value of the gamma function. 1gamma can sometimes be more use-
ful than the gamma function itself, because P grows so quickly that using it in cal-
culations may cause overflow.
