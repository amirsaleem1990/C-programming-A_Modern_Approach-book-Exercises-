The Standard Library

Diagnostics

Contains only the assert macro, which allows us to insert self-checks into a pro-
gram. If any check fails, the program terminates.

Character Handling

Provides functions for classifying characters and for converting letters from lower
to upper case or vice versa.

Errors

Provides errno (‘error number”). an Ivalue that can be tested after a call of cer-
tain library functions to see if an error occurred during the call.

Characteristics of Floating Types

Provides macros that describe the characteristics of floating types, including their
range and accuracy.

Sizes of Integer Types

Provides macros that describe the characteristics of integer types (including char-
acter types), including their maximum and minimum values.

Localization

Provides functions to help a program adapt its behavior to a country or other geo-
graphic region. Locale-specific behavior includes the way numbers are printed
(such as the character used as the decimal point), the format of monetary values
(the currency symbol, for example). the character set, and the appearance of the
date and time.

Mathematics

Provides common mathematical functions. including trigonometric, hyperbolic,
exponential, logarithmic, power, nearest integer, absolute value, and remainder
functions.

Nonlocal Jumps

Provides the set jmp and longjmp functions. set-jmp “marks” a place in a pro-
gram; longjmp can then be used to return to that place later. These functions
