called), the parentheses/braces aren't matched. If stack_overflow is called, have the
program print the message Stack overflow and terminate immediately.

Modify the poker.c prograin of Section 10.5 by moving the num_in_rank and
num _ in suit arrays into main, which will pass them as arguments to read_cards
and analyze hand.

Remove the num in _ rank, num_in suit, and card _ exists arrays from the
poker.c program of Section 10.5. Have the program store the cards in a 5 x 2 array
instead. Each row of the array will represent a card. For example, if the array is named
hand, then hand [0] [0] will store the rank of the first card and hand [0] [1] will store
the suit of the first card.

Modify the poker. c program of Section 10.5 by having it recognize an additional cate-
gory, “royal flush” (ace, king. queen, jack, ten of the same suit). À royal flush ranks higher
than all other hands.

Modify the poker .c program of Section 10.5 by allowing ‘“ace-low” straights (acc, two,
three, four, five).

Some calculators (notably those from Hewlett-Packard) use a system of writing mathemati-
cal expressions known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). In this notation, operators are
placed afer their operands instead of berween their operands. For example, | + 2 would bc
written ! 2 + in RPN, and ! + 2 * 3 would be written ! 2 3 # + RPN expressions can easily
be evaluated using a stack. The algorithm involves reading the operators and operands in an
expression from left to right, performing the following actions:

When an operand is encountered, push it onto the stack.

When an operator is encountered, pop its operands from the stack. perform the opera-
tion on those operands, and then push the result onto the stack.

Write a program that evaluates RPN expressions. The operands will be single-digit integers.
Thc operators are +, — *, /. and =. The = operator causes the top stack item to be displayed;
afterwards, the stack is cleared and the user is prompted to enter another expression. Thce
process continues until the user enters à character that is not an operator or opcrand:

Enter an RPN expression: 1 2 3 #* + =
Value of expression: 7

Enter an RPN expression: 5 8 * 4 9 - / =
Value of expression: -8

Enter an RPN expression: q

 

 

If the stack overflows, the program will display the message Expression is too com-
plex and terminate. If the stack underflows (because of an expression such as | 2 + +), the
program will display the message Not enough operands in expression and termi-
nate. Hints: Incorporate the stack code from Section 10.2 into your program. Use
scanf (" %c", &ch) to read the operators and operands.

Write a program that prompts the user for a number and then displays the number, using
characters to simulate the effect of a seven-segment display:

Enter a number: 491-9014

Characters other than digits should be ignored. Write the program so that the maximum
number of digits is controlled by a macro named MAX_DIGITS. which has the value 10. Tf
