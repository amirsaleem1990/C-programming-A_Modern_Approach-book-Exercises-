Equality Operators

Although the relational operators are denoted by the same symbols as in many
other programming languages, the equality operators have a unique appearance
(Table 5.2). The “equal to” operator is two adjacent = characters, not one, since a
sinele = character represents the assignment operator. The ‘’not equal to” operator
is also two characters: ! and =.

Clever programmers sometimes exploit the fact that the relational and equality
operators return integer values. For example. the value of the expression (i >= j)
+ (i == j) is either O, 1, or 2, depending on whether i 1s less than, greater than,
or equal to j, respectively. Tricky coding like this generally isn’t a good idea, how-
ever; it makes programs hard to understand.

More complicated logical expressions can be built from simpler ones by using the
logical operators: and, or, and not (Table 5.3). The ! operator is unary, while &&
and | | are binary.

 

Table 5.3
Logical Operators

 

The logical operators produce either O or ! as their result. Often, the operands
will have values of O or 1, but this isn°t a requirement; the logical operators treat
any nonzero operand as a true value and any zero operand as a false value.

The logical operators behave as follows:

m ! expr has the value | if expr has the value 0.

m expri && expr2 has the value 1 if the values of expr] and expr2 are both non-
Zero.
