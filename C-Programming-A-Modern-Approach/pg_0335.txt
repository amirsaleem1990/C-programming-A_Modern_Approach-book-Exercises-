file_name points to a string containing a file name. The function should store the exten-
sion on the file name in the string pointed to by extension. For example, if the file name
is"memo.txt"ﬂheﬁnæﬁm1th…me"txt"h1…esumgpomuﬂtobyextensionﬂf
the file name doesn’t have an extension, the function should store an empty string (a single
null character) in the string pointed to by extension. Keep the function as simple as pos-
sible by having it use the strlen and strcepy functions.

Write the following function:
void build_index url (const char *domain, char *index _url) ;

domain points to a string containing an Internet domain, such as "knking.com". The
function should add "http://www." to the beginning of this string and "/
index.html" to the end of the string, storing the result in the string pointed to by
index_url. (In this example, the result will be "http://www.knking. com/
index.html".) You may assume that index ur1l points to a variable that is long
enought to hold the resulting string. Keep the function as simple as possible by having it use
the strcat and strcpy functions.

What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.hs>

int main(void)

{

char s[] = "Hsjodi", *p;

for (p = s; *p; p++)
_._*p;

puts(s) ;

return 0;

}

Let £ be the following function:

int f(char *s, char *t)

(

char *p1, *p2;
for (p1 = s; *pl; pl++) |

for (p2 = t; *p2; p2++)
if (*p1 == *p2) break;
if (*p2 == '\0') break;

}

return pl - s;

(a) What is the value of £ ("abcd", "babc") ?
(b) What is the value of £ ("abcd", "bca") ?
(c) In general, what value does f return when passed two strings s and t?

Use the techniques of Section 13.6 to condense the count_spaces function of Section
13.4. In particular, replace the £or statement by a while loop.
Write the following function:

bool test_extension(const char *file name,
const char *extension}) ;
