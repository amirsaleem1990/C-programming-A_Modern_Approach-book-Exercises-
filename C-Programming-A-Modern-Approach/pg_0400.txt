The justi£y program of Section 15.3 justifies lines by inserting extra spaces between
words. The way the write line function currently works, the words closer to the end of
à line tend to have slightly wider gaps between them than the words at the beginning. (For
example. the words closer to the end might have three spaces between them. while the
words closer to the béginning might be separated by only two spaces.) Improve the program
by having write_line alternate between putting the larger gaps at the end of the line and
putting them at the beginning of the line.

Modify the justi£y program of Section 15.3 by having the read_word function
(instead of ma in) store the * character at the end of à word that’s been truncated.

Modify the gsort.c program of Section 9.6 so that the quicksort and split func-
tions are in a separate file named quicksort.c. Create a header file named quick-
sort.h that contains prototypes for the two functions and have both gsort .c and
quicksort .c include this file.

Modify the remind. c program of Section 13.5 so that the read_line function Is In à
scparate file named readline. c. Create a header fîle named readline.h that contains
a prototype for the function and have both remind.c and readline.c include this file.

Modify Programming Project 6 from Chapter 1O so that it has separate stack.h and
stack. c files. as described in Section 15.2.
