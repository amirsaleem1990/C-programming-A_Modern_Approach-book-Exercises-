Wide-String Concatenation Functions

wchar t *wcscat (wchar t * restrict sl,
const wchar t * restrict s2);
wchar E *wvesncat (wchar t * restrict sl,
const wchar t * restrict s2,
size t n);

The functions in this group are wide-character versions of the string concatenation
functions found in <string. h> and described in Section 23.6. The <wchar .h>
functions have arguments of type wchar t * instead of char *. but their behavior
is mostly the same as the <string.h> functions. Table 25.15 shows the corre-

spondence between the <string .h> functions and their wide-character counter-
parts.

Wide-String Comparison Functions

int wcscmp (const wchar t *s1, const wchar t *s2);
int wcscoll (const wchar t *s1, const wchar t *s2);
int wcsneomp(const wchar t *s1, const wchar t *s2,
size t n);
size t wcsxfrm(wchar t * restrict s1l,
const wchar t * restrict s2,
size t n);
int wmemcmp (const wchar t * sl, const wchar t * s2,
size t n);

The functions in this group are wide-character versions of the string comparison
functions found in <string.h> and described in Section 23.6. The
<wchar .h> functions have arguments of type wchar t * instead of char *.
but their behavior is mostly the same as the <string. h> functions. Table 25.16
shows the correspondence between the <string.h> functions and their wide-
character counterparts.
