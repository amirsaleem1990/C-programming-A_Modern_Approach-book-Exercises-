Here’s how the monetary quantity 7593.86 would be formatted in the two
locales, depending on the sign of the quantity and whether the formatting is local
or international:

U.S.A. Finland
Local format (positive) $7,593.86 7 593,86 EUR
Local format (negative) -$7,593.86 - 7 593,86 EUR
International format (positive) USD 7,593.86 7 593,86 EUR
International format (negative) -USD 7,593.86 - 7 593,86 EUR

Keep in mind that none of C”s library functions are able to format monetary quan-
tities automatically. Is up to the programmer to use the information in the 1conv
structure to accomplish the formatting.

One of the biggest problems in adapting programs to different locales is the char-

Latin1>73 _ acter-set issue. ASCII and its extensions, which include Latin-1, are the most pop-
ular character sets in North America. Elsewhere, the situation is morc complicated.
In many countries, computers employ character sets that are similar to ASCIIL. but
lack certain characters; we*1t discuss this issue further in Section 25.3. Other coun-
tries, especially those in Asia, face a different problem: written languages that
require à very large character set, usually numbering in the thousands.
