To compensate for omitting the third expression, we’ve arranged for i to be decre-
mented inside the loop body.

 

@ŒD  for Statements in C99

In C99, the first expression in a £or statement can be replaced by a declaration.
This feature allows the programmer to declare a variable for use by the loop:

for (int i = O; i < n; i++)

The variable i need not have been declared prior to this statement. (In fact, if a
declaration of i already exists, this statement creates a new version of i that will
be used solely within the loop.)

À variable declared by a £or statement can*t be accessed outside the body of
the loop (we say that it’s not visible outside the loop):

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) |

praint£("%d", i); /* legal; i is visible inside loop */
}
printf("%d", i): /-k*—k WRONG ***/

Having a £or statement declare its own control variable is usually a good
idea: it’s convenient and it can make programs easier to understand. However, if
the program needs to access the variable after loop termination, it’s necessary to
use the older form of the £for statement.

Incidentally, a £or statement may declare more than one variable, provided
that all variables have the same type:

for (int à = O, j = 0; i < n; i++)
