PROGRAM

Printing Expressions

print£ isn’t limited to displaying numbers stored in variables; it can display the
value of any numeric expression. Taking advantage of this property can simplify a
program and reduce the number of variables. For instance, the statements

volume = height * length * width;
print£ ("d\n"', volume) ;

could be replaced by
print£ ("4d\n"', height * length * width}) ;

print£'s ability to print expressions illustrates one of C’s general principles:
Wherever a value is needed, any expression of the same type will do.

Reading Input

Because the dweight . c program calculates the dimensional weight of just one
box, it isn’t especially useful. To improve the program, we’1l need to allow the user
to enter the dimensions.

 

Reading a float value requires a slightly different call of scan£:

scanf ("%f£", &X) ; /* reads a float value; stores into x */

£ works only with variables of type £loat, so l’m assuming that x is a float
variable. The "%£" string tells scan£ to look for an input value in Float format
(the number may contain a decimal point, but doesn*t have Lo).

Computing the Dimensional Weight of a Box (Revisited)

Here’s an improved version of the dimensional weight program in which the user
