e Enumerated types
m Floating types (£loat, double, long double)

@ C99 has a more complicated hierarchy lor its arithmetic types:

u ÎInteger types
e char

e Signed integer types, both standard (signed char. short int. int,
long int, long long int) and extended

e Unsigned integer types, both standard (unsigned char, unsigned
short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int. unsigned
long long int, Bool) and extended

e Enumerated types
m Floating types
e Real floating types (Float, double. long double)

e Complex types (Éloat _Complex, double Complex, long dou-
ble Complex)

Escape Sequences

À character constant is usually one character enclosed in single quotes. as we’ve
seen In previous examples. However, certain special characters—including the
new-line character—can’t be written in this way, because they*re invisible (non-
printing) or because they can’t be entered from the keyboard. So that programs can
deal with every character in the underlying character set, C provides a special nota-
tion, the escape sequence.

There are two kinds of escape sequences: character escapes and numeric
escapes. We saw à partial list of character escapes in Section 3.1: Table 7.5 gives
the complete set.

 

 

Table 7.5 Name Escape Sequence
Character Escapes Alcrt (bell) \a
Backspace \b
Form feed \f
New line \n
Carriage return \r
Horizontal tab \t
Vertical tab \v
Backslash \ \
Question mark \ ?
Single quote \"
Double quote \"

 

 

 

The \a. \b. \£. \r, \t, and \v escapes represent common ASCII control
characters. The \n escape represents the ASCII line-feed character. The \\ escape
allows a character constant or string to contain the \ character. The \' escape
