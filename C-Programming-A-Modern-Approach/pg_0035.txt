Chapter2 C Fundamentals

pun.c

The following program, which we'll name pun.c, displays this message each
time it iS run.

#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)

{

printf("To C, or not to C: that is the question.\n") ;
return 0;
}

Section 2.2 explains the form of this program in some detail. For now, PIl just
make a few brief observations. The line

#include <stdio.h>

is necessary to “include” information about C’s standard 1/O (inpuVoutput) library.
The program's executable code goes inside main. which represents the “main”’
program. The only line inside main is a command to display the desired message.
print£ is a function from the standard I/O library that can produce nicely for-
matted output. The \n code tells print£ to advance to the next line after printing
the message. The line

return 0;

indicates that the program “returns” the value 0 to the operating system when it ter-
minates.

Compiling and Linking

Despite its brevity, getting pun. c lo run is more involved than you might expeck.
First, we need to create a file named pun. c containing the program (any text edi-
tor will do). The name of the file doesn’t matter, but the .c extension is often
required by compilers.

Next, we've got to convert the program to a form that the machine can exe-
cute.
