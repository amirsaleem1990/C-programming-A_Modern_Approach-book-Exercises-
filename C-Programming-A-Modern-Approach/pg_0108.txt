Conditional Expressions

conditional
expression

 

The conditional expression i > j ? i - j in the first assignment to k returns the
value of either i or j, depending on which one is larger. Since i has the value |
and j has the value 2, the i > j comparison fails, and the value of the conditional
is 2, which is assigned to k. In the second assignment to k, the i >= 0 comparison
succeeds; the conditional expression (i >= O ? i : O) has the value !, which 1s
then added to j lo produce 3. The parentheses are necessary, by the way: the prece-
dence of the conditional operator is less than that of the other operators we‚Äùve drs-
cussed so far, with the exception of the assignment operators.
