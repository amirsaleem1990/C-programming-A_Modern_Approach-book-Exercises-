Write a program that calculates the remaining balance on a loan after the first, second, and
third monthly payments:

Enter amount of loan: 20000.00
Enter interest rate: 6.0

Enter monthly payment: 3866.66

Balance remaining after first payment: $S19713.34
Balance remaining after second payment: $19425.25
Balance remaining after third payment: $19135.71

Display each balance with two digits after the decimal point. Hint: Each month. the balance
is decreased by the amount of the payment, but increased by the balance times the monthly
interest rate. To find the monthly int√®rest rate, convert the interest rate entered by the user Lo
a percentage and divide it by 12.
