PROGRAM

135  Using the C String Library — 293

To test whether str1 1s less than or equal to str2. we'’d write

if (stromp(str1, str2)

<= 0) /* is str1 <= str2? */

By choosing the proper relational operator (<, <=, >, >=) or equality operator (==,
! =), we can test any possible relationship between str1 and str2.

stremp compares strings based on their lexicographic ordering, which re-
sembles the way words are arranged in a dictionary. More precisely, stremp con-
siders s1 lo be less than s2 if either one of the following conditions 1s satisfied:

u The first / characters of s1 and s2 match, but the (/+1)st character of s1 is
less than the (/+1)st character of s2. For example, "abc" is less than "bced",
and "abd" is less than "abe*.

u Al| characters of s1 match s2. but s1 1s shorter than s2. For example,
"abc" 1s less than "abecd".

Âs it compares characters from two strings. stremp looks at the numerical
codes that represent the characters. Some knowledge of the underlying character
set 1s helpful in order to predict what stremp will do. For example, here are a few
important properties of the ASCII character set:

e The characters in each of the sequences A—Z, a-z, and 0-9 have consecutive
codes.

u All upper-case letters are less than all lower-case letters. (In ASCII, codes
between 65 and 90 represent upper-case letters; codes between 97 and 122
represent lower-case letters.)

e Dicits are less than letters. (Codes between 48 and 57 represent digits.)

w Spaces are less than all printing characters. (The space character has the value

32 in ASCIL.)

Printing a One-Month Reminder List

To illustrate the use of the C string library. we’11 now develop a program that prints
a one-month list of daily reminders. The user will enter à series of reminders, with
each prefixed by a day of the month. When the user enters O instead of a valid day.
the program will print a list of all reminders entered, sorted by day. Here’s what a
session with the program will look like:
