B Selection Statements

Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and
their logic but by the completeness of their case analysis.

return statement >2.2

expression statement > 4.5

 

This chapter discusses the selection statements and the compound statement.
(Chapter 6 covers the iteration statements, the jump statements. and the null state-
ment.) Before we can write 1£ statements, we’1] need logical expressions: condi-
tions that if statements can test. Section 5.1 explains how logical expressions are
built from the relational operators (<. <=, >. and >=), the equality operators (==
and ! =), and the logical operators (&&, | |, and !). Section 5.2 covers the i £ state-
ment and compound statement, as well as introducing the conditional operator
(?:). which can test a condition within an expression. Section 5.3 describes the
switch statement.
