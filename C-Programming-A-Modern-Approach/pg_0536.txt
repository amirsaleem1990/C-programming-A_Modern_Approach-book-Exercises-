20.1  Bitwise Operators 511

Bitwise Complement, And, Exclusive Or, and Inclusive Or

Table 20.2 lists the remaining bitwise operators.

 

Symbol Meaning

 

- bitwise complement

& bitwise and

A . . .
bitwise exclusive or

| bitwise inclusive or

 

 

 

The - operator is unary; the integer promotions are performed on its operand. The
other operators are binary; the usual arithmetic conversions are performed on their
operands.

The -. & “, and | operators perform Boolean operations on all bits in their
operands. The - operator produces the complement of its operand, with zeros
replaced by ones and ones replaced by zeros. The & operator performs a Boolean
and operation on all corresponding bits in its two operands. The * and | operators
are similar (both perform a Boolean or operation on the bits in their operands):
however, “ produces O whenever both operands have a 1 bit. whereas | produces
].

 

Don't confuse the bitwise operators & and | with the /ogical operators && and |
The bitwise operators sometimes produce the same results as the logical operators,
but they’re not equivalent.

 

The following examples illustrate the effect of the —. & “, and | operators:

unsigned short i, j, kK;

= 21; /* i is now 21 (binary 0000000000010101) */
j = 56; /* j is now 56 (binary 0000000000111000) */
k = —-i; /* k is now 65514 (binary 1111111111101010) */
k = i & j; /* k is now 16 (binary 0000000000010000) */
k = i “ ;; /* k is now 45 (binary 0000000000101101) */
k = i | j; /* k is now 61 (binary 0000000000111101) */

The value shown for -i is based on the assumption that an unsigned short
value occupies 16 bits.

The - operator deserves special mention. since we can use it to help make
even low-level programs more portable. Suppose that we need an integer whose
bits are all 1. The preferred technique is to write -0, which doesn‘t depend on the
number of bits in an integer. Similarly, if we need an integer whose bits are all |
excepi for the last five, we could write -Ox1f.
