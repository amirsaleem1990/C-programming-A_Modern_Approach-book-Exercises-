bits. As a result, a single-precision number has a maximum value of approximately
3.40 x 10%, with a precision of about 6 decimal digits.

The |EEE standard also describes two other formats, single extended precision
and double extended precision. The standard doesn't specify the number of bits in
these formats, although it requires that the single extended type occupy at least 43
bits and the double extended type at least 79 bits. For more information about the
|EEE standard and floating-point arithmetic in general, see "What every computer
scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic” by David Goldberg (ACM
Computing Surveys, vol. 23, no. 1 (March 1991): 5-48).

Table 7.4 shows the characteristics of the floating types when implemented
according to the IEEE standard. (The table shows the smallest positive normalized
values. Subnormal numbers can be smaller.) The long double lype isn’t shown
in the table, since its length varies from one machine to another, with 80 bits and
128 bits being the most common sizes.

 

 

 

 

Type Smallest Positive Value Largest Value Precision
float 1.17549 x 107 3.40282 x 10? 6 digits
double 2.22507 x 107* 1.79769 x 10°°$ 15 digits

 

On computers that don*t follow the IEEE standard, Table 7.4 won't be valid.
In fact. on some machines, float may have the same set of values as double, or
double may have the same values as long double. Macros that define the
characteristics of the floating types can be found in the <float .h> header.

In C99. the floating types are divided into two categories. The £loat, dou-
ble, and long double types fall into one category, called the real floating
types. Floating types also include the complex types (£loat Complex, dou-
ble Complex, and long double Complex). which are new in C99,

Floating Constants

Floating constants can be written in a variety of ways. The following constants, for
example, are all valid ways of writing the number 57.0:

57.0 57. 57.0e0 57E0 5.7e1 5.7e+1 .57e2 5S570.e-l

À floating constant must contain à decimal point and/or an exponent; the exponent
indicates the power of 10 by which the number is to be scaled. If an exponent 1s
present, it must be preceded by the leiter E (or e). An optional + or - sign may
appear after the E (or e).

By default, floating constants are stored as double-precision numbers. In other
words, when a C compiler finds the constant 57.0 in a program, it arranges for the
number to be stored in memory in the same format as a double variable. This
rule generally causes no problems, since double values are converted automati-
cally to £loat when necessary.
