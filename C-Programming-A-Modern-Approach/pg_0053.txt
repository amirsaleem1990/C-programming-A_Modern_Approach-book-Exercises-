Chapter2 C Fundamentais

C allows us to insert any amount of space—blanks, tabs, and new-line characters—
between tokens. This rule has several important consequences for program layout:

CEIN

u Statements can be divided over any number of lines. The following statement,

for example, is so long that it would be hard to squeeze it onto a single line:

printf ("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n",
(volume + INCHES PER POUND - 1) / INCHES PER POUND) ;

m Space between tokens makes it easier for the eye to separate them. For this

reason, l usually put a space before and after each operator:
volume = height * length * width;

] also put a space after each comma. Some programmers go even further, put-
ting spaces around parentheses and other punctuation.

u /ndentation can make nesting easier to spot. For example, we should indent

declarations and statements to make it clear that they’re nested inside main.

w Blank lines can divide a program into logical units, making it easier for the

reader to discern the program's structure. À program with no blank lines 1s as
hard to read as a book with no chapters.

The celsius.c program of Section 2.6 illustrates several of these guide-

lines. Let’s take a closer look at the main function in that program:

int main (void)

(

}

float fahrenheit, celsius;

printf ("Enter Fahrenheit temperature: ") ;
scanf ("%$f", &fahrenheit) ;

celsius = (fahrenheit - FREEZING PT) * SCALE FACTOR;
printf("Celsius equivalent: %.1£\n", celsius) ;

return 0;

First, observe how the space around =. -, and * makes these operators stand out.
Second, notice how the indentation of declarations and statements makes it obvi-
ous that they all belong to main. Finally, note how blank lines divide main into
five parts: (1) declaring the £ahrenheit and celsius variables; (2) obtaining
the Fahrenheit temperature; (3) calculating the value of celsius; (4) printing the
Celsius temperature; and (5) returning to the operating system.

While we>re on the subject of program layout, notice how l've placed the {

token underneath main () and put the matching } on a separate line, aligned with
{. Putting } on a separate line lets us insert or delete statements at the end of the
function; aligning it with { makes it easy to spot the end of main.

ÀA final note: Although extra spaces can be added berween tokens, it's not pos-
