Q & À 91

check if the -Wparentheses option is used or if -Wall (all warnings) is
selected. GCC allows the programmer to suppress the warning in a particular case
by enclosing the i £ condition in a second set of parentheses:

i£ ((i = j))

C books seem to use several different styles of indentation and brace place-
ment for compound statements. Which style is best?

According to The New Hacker’s Dictionary (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996),
there are four common styles of indentation and brace placement:

m The K&R style, used in Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Lan-
guage, is the one l’ve chosen for the programs in this book. In the K&R style,
the left brace appears at the end of a line:

if (line num == MAX LINES) {
line num = O0;
page_num++;

}

The K&R style keeps programs compact by not putting the left brace on a line
by itself. À disadvantage: the left brace can be hard to find. (I don’t consider
this a problem, since the indentatièon of the inner statements makes it clear
where the left brace should be.) The K&R style is the one most often used in
Java, by the way.

m The A/lman style, named after Eric Allman (the author of sendmail and
other UNIX utilities), puts the left brace on a separate line:

if (line num == MAX LINES)

line num = 0;
page_num++;

;

This style makes it easy to check that braces come in matchins pairs.

u The Whitesmiths style, popularized by the Whitesmiths C compiler, dictates
that braces be indented:

if (line num == MAX LINES)

line num = 0;
page_num++ ;

}

m The GNU style, used in software developed by the GNU Project, indents the
braces, then further indents the inner statements:

if (line num == MAX LINES)

line num = 0;
page_num++;
