be !. and so forth. Use a variable to keep track of how many consecutive Os have been
stored: when the count reaches N, it’s time to storc |.

Assume that the following array contains à wcek's worth of hourly temperature readings,
with cach row containing the readings for one day:

int temperatures [7] [24] ;

Write a statement that uses the search function (see Exercise 7) to search the entire
temperatures array for the value 32.

Write a loop that prints all temperature readings stored in row i of the temperatures
array (see Exercise 14). Usc à pointer to visit each element of the row.

Write a loop that prints the highest temperature in the temperatures array (see Exercise
14) for each day of the week. The loop body should call the £ind_largest function,
passing it one row of the array at a time.

Rewrite the following function to use pointer arithmetic instead of array subscripting. (In
other words. eliminate the variables i and ÿ and all uses of the [] operator.) Use a single
loop instead of nested loops.

int sum two _ dimensional array(const int a[] (LEN], int n)

{

int i, j, sum = O0;

for (i = O0; i < n; i++)
for (j = 0; j < LEN; j++)
sum += al[il (5)] ;

return sum;

}

Write the evaluate position function described in Exercise 13 of Chapter 9. Use
pointer arithmetic—not subscripling—to visit array elements. Use a single loop instead of
nested loops.

Programming Projects

(a) Write a program that reads a message, then prints the reversal of the message:

Enter a message: Don't get mad, get even.
Reversal is: .neve teg ,dam teg t'noD

 

Hint: Read the message one character at a time (using getchar) and store the characters in
an array. Stop reading when the array is full or the character read is " \n'.

(b) Revise the program to use a pointer instead of an integer to keep track of the current
position in the array.
(a) Write à program that reads a message. then checks whether it’s a palindrome (the letters

in the message are the same from left to right as from right to left):

Enter a message: He lived as a devil, eh?
Palindrome

 

Enter a message: Madam, I am Adam.
Not a palindrome
