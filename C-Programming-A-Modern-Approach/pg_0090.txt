Expression Statements

C has the unusual rule that ary expression can be used as a statement. That 1s, any
expression—regardless of its Lype or what 1t computes—can be turned into a state-

into a statement:

++i;

When this statement 1s executed, i is first incremented. then the new value of i is
fetched (as though it were to be used in an enclosing expression). However, since
++i ISN’( part of à larger expression, its value 1s discarded and the next statement
executed. (The change to i is permanent, of course.)

Since its value 1s discarded, there’s little point in using an expression as a
statement unless the expression has a side effect. Let’s look at three examples. In
