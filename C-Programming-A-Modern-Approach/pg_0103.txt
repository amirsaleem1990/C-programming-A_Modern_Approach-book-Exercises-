i £ statement with
else clause

{ line num = 0; page _num++; }

For clarity, PH! usually put a compound statement on several lines, with one state-

{

line_num = O0;
page _ num++;

}

Notice that each inner statement still ends with a semicolon, but the compound
statement itself does not.

Here’s what a compound statement would look like when used inside an if
statement:

if (line num == MAX LINES) |{
line num = 0;
page _num++;

}

 

An i£ statement may have an else clause:

LÉ ( expression ) statement else sratement

The statement that follows the word else is executed if the expression in paren-
theses has the value 0.

Here’s an example of an i f statement with an el se clause:

When an if£ statement contains an else clause, a layout issue arises: where
should the else be placed? Many C programmers align it with the i£ at the

usually indented, but 1f they’re short they can be put on the same line as the i £ and
else:
