How many tokens are there in the following statement?

answer= (3*q-p*p) /3;
Insert spaces between the tokens in Exercise $ to make the statement casier to read.

In the Aweight .c program (Section 2.4). which spaces are essential?

Programming Projects

Write a program that uses print£ to display the following picture on the screen:

Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius, using the for-
mula v = 4/3m”. Write the fraction 4/3 as 4 . O£/3.0f. (Try writing it as 4/3. What hap-
pens?) Hint: C doesn’t have an exponentiation operator, so you’Il need to multiply r by itself

twice to compute .

Modify the program of Programming Projeet 2 so that it prompts the user to enter the radius
of the sphere.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a dollars-and-cents amount, then displays the
amount with 5% tax added:

Enter an amount: 100.00

With tax added: $S105.00

Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x and then displays the value of the
following polynomial:

30424 - 57 - 074 Tx — 6

Hint: C doesn’t have an exponentiation operator, so you’Il need to multiply x by itself
repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x. (For example, x * x * x is x cubed.)
Modify the program of Programming Project 5 so that the polynomial is evaluated using the
following formula:

((((Gx + 2)x — 5)x — Hx + 7)x—6

Note that the modified program performs fewer multiplications. This technique for evaluat-
ing polynomials 1s known as Horner’s Rule.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a U.S. dollar amount and then shows how to pay
that amount using the smallest number of $20, $10, $S, and $1 bills:

Enter a dollar amount: 93

$20 bills: 4
$S10 bills: 1
$5 bills: O
$S1 bills: 3
