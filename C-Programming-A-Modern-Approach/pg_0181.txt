Which of the following are not legal types in C?

(a) short unsigned int
(b) short float

(c) long double
(d) unsigned long

I c is a variable of type char, which one of the following statements is illegal?
(a) i += c; /* i has type int */

(b) ce = 2 * c - 1;

(c) putchar (c) ;

(d) print£ (c) ;

Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number 65? (Assume that the
character set 1s ASCII.)

(Zl) À!

(b) 0b1000001

(c) 0101

(d) Ox41

For each of the following 1tems of data, specify which one of the types char, short, int.
or long is the smallest one guarantced to be large enough to store the item.

(a) Days in a month

(b) Days in a year

(c) Minutes in a day

(d) Seconds in a day

For each of the following character escapes, give the equivalent octal escape. (Assume that
the character set is ASCII.) You may wish to consult Appendix E, which lists the numerical
codes for ASCIT characters.

(a) \b
(b) \n
(c) \r
(d) \t

Repeat Exercise 7, but give the equivalent hexadecimal escape.
Suppose that i and j arc variables of type int. What is the type of thc expression i / j +
'a'?

Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is à variable of type 1ong, and k is a variable of
type unsigned int. What is the type of the expression i + (int) j * kK?

Suppose that i is a variable of type int,. £ is a variable of type float. and d is a variable
of type double. What is the type of the expression i * £ / d?

Suppose that i is à variable of type int, £ is a variable of type Float, and d is a variable
of type double. Explain what conversions take place during the execution of the following
statement:

d = à + f;
