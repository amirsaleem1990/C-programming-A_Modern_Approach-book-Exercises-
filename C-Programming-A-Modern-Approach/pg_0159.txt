On occasion. it may be necessary to force the compiler to store a floating con-
stant in £loat or long double format. To indicate that only single precision is
desired, put the letter F (or £) at the end of the constant (for example, 57 . OF). To
indicate that a constant should be stored in long double format, put the letter L
(or 1) at the end (57 . OL).

C99 has a provision for writing floating constants in hexadecimal. Such a con-
stant begins with Ox or OX (like a hexadecimal integer constant). This feature is
rarely used.

Reading and Writing Floating-Point Numbers

Âs we’ve discussed, the conversion specifications %e, f, and %g are used for
reading and writing single-precision floating-point numbers. Values of types dou -
ble and long double require slightly different conversions:

m When reading a value of type double, put the letter 1 in front of e, f, or g:

double d;

scanf ("31f", &d);

Note: Use 1 only in a scan£ format string, not a printf string. In a
print£ format string, the e, f, and g conversions can be used to write either
float or double values. (C99 legalizes the use of %le, %1F, and %1g in
calls of print£, although the 1 has no effect.)

= When reading or writing a value of type long double, put the letter L in
front of e, £, or g:

long double 1d;

scanf£ ("%$Lf", &ld);
print£ ("%Lf", 1d);

Character Types

The only remaining basic type is char, the character type. The values of type
char can vary from one computer to another, because different machines may
have different underlying character sets.

 

 

Character Sets

Today's most popular character set is ASCII (American Standard Code for Informa-
tion Interchange), a 7-bit code capable of representing 128 characters. In ASCII,
the digits O to 9 are represented by the codes 0110000-0111001, and the upper-
case letters À to Z are represented by 1000001—1011010. ASCII is often extended
