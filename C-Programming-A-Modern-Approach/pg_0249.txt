PROGRAM Guessing a Number

To get more experience with external variables. we'Il write a simple game-playing
program. The program generates a random number between ! and 100, which the
user attempts Lo guess in as few tries as possible. Hereâ€™s what the user will see
when the program 1s run:

Guess the secret number between 1 and 100.

A newv number has been chosen.
Enter guess: 55

Too low; try again.

Enter guess: 65

Too high; try again.

Enter guess: 60

Too high; try again.

Enter guess: 58

You won in 4 guesses!

Play again? (Y/N) y

A new number has been chosen.
Enter guess: 78

Too high; try again.

Enter guess: 34

You won in 2 guesses!

Play again? (Y/N) n

This program will need to carry out several different tasks: initializing the ran-
dom number generator. choosing a secret number, and interacting with the user
until the correct number is picked. !f we write a separate function to handle each
task, we might end up with the following program.

quess.c _ /* Asks user to quess a hidden number */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

#define MAX NUMBER 100

/* external variable */
int secret _number ;

/* prototypes */

void initialize number generator (void) ;
void choose _new secret _number (void) ;
void read guesses (void) ;

int main (void)

{

char command ;
