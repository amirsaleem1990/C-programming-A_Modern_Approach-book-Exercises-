The first declaration states that height is a variable of type int, meaning that
height can store an integer value. The second declaration says that profit 1s a
variable of type float.

 

Notice that each complete declaration ends with a semicolon.
Our first template for main didn’t include declarations. When main contains
declarations, these must precede statements:

int main (void)

{

declarations
statements

}

blocks =103 Às we'll see in Chapter 9, this Is true of functions in general, as well as blocks
(statements that contain embedded declarations). Às a matter of style. it’s a good
idea to leave a blank line between the declarations and the statements.

Assignment

À variable can be given a value by means of assignment. For example, the state-

ments
height = 8B;
length = 12;

width = 10;

assign values to height, length, and width. The numbers 8, 12, and 10 are
said to be constants.

Before à variable can be assigned a value—or used in any other way, for that
matter—it must first be declared. Thus, we could write

int height ;
height = 8;

but not

height = 8; /*** WRONG ***/
int height;
