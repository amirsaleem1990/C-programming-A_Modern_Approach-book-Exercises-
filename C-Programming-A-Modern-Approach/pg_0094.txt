(d) i = 1; j = 2; k = 3;
print£("#d", (i + 5) % (j + 2) / K);
@ *2. Tf i and ; are positive integers, does (-i) /j always have the same value as - (i/j) ? Jus-
tify vour answer.

3.  What is the value of each of the following expressions in C89? (Give all possible values if
an expression may have more than one value.)

(a) 8 / 5

(b) -8 / 5
(c) 8 / -S
(d) -8 / -S

4, _ Repeat Exercise 3 for C99.

A

What is the value of each of the following expressions in C89? (Give all possible values if
an expression may have more than one value.)

(a) 8 % 5

(b) -8 % S
(c) 8 % -5
(d) -8 % -5

6. Repeat Exercise 5 for C99.

7, The algorithm for computing the UPC check digit ends with the following steps:

Subtract ! from the total.
Compute the remainder when the adjusted total 1s divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 9.

Tts tempting to try to simplify the algorithm by using these steps instead:

Compute the remainder when the total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 10.

Why doesn't this technique work?

S.  Would the upc.c program sull work if the expression 9 - ((total - 1) % 10) were
replacecd by (10 - (total % 10)) % 10?

Section 4.2 @ 9  Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments. Assume that i. j.
and k are int variables.

(a) 1 = 7; J

i *= j + l,'
printf("%d %d", i, j);
(b) i = J = k l;

i -= j -= k;
print£("%d %d %
(d) i = 2; j = 1; K = O0;
i *= j *= k;
print£("%d %d %d", i, j, kK);
