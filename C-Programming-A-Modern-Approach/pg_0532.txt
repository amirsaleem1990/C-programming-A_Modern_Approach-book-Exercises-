Starting from the queue .h header of Exercise |, create a file named queueADT .h that
defines the following Queue type:

typedef struct queue type *Queue ;

queue _type 1s an incomplete structure type. Create à file named queueADT. c that con-
tains the full definition of queue_type as well as definitions for all the functions in
queue .h. Use a fixed-lensth array to store the îtems in a queue (sce Exercise 3(a)). Create
a file named queueclient. c (similar to the stackclient . c file of Section 19.4) that
creates (Wo queues and performs opérations on them. Be sure to provide create and
destroy functions for your ADT.

Modify Programming Project 5 so that the items in a queue are stored in a dynamically allo-
cated array whose length is passed to the create function.

Modify Programming Project 5 so that the items in a queue are stored in a linked list (see
Exercise 3(b)).
