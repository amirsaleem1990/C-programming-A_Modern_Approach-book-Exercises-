The switch Statement

[n everyday programming, we'll often necd to compare an expression against a
series of values to see which one it currently matches. We saw in Section 5.2 that a
cascaded i £ statement can be used for this purpose. For example, the following
cascaded i£ statement prints the English word that corresponds to a numerical
grade:

 

When this statement 1s executed, the value of the variable grade 1s tested against
4, 3, 2, 1, and O. If it matches 4, for example, the message Excellent is printed,
then the break statement transfers control to the statement following the
switch. If the value of grade doesn’t match any of the choices listed, the
default case applies, and the message I1legal grade 1s printed.
