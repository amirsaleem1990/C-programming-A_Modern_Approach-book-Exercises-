Chapter5 Selection Statements

5.1 Logical Expressions

Several of C’s statements, including the i£ statement. must test the value of an
expression to see if it is “true” or “false.”” For example, an i £ statement might need
to test the expression i < j; à true value would indicate that i is less than .

    

With this in mind, let’s look at the operators that are used to build logi-
cal expressions.

C”s relational operators (Table 5.1) correspond to the <, >, <, and 2 operators of
mathematics, except that they produce 0 (false) or ! (true) when used in expres-
sions. For example, the value of 10 < 11 is I; the value of 11 < 10 is 0.

Table 5.1
Relational Operators

 

The relational operators can be used to compare integers and floating-point
numbers, with operands of mixed types allowed. Thus, 1 < 2.5 has the value |,

while 5.6 < 4 has the value 0.
