Basic Types

Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers—
not symbols. We measure our understanding (and control)
by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.

So far, we’ve used only two of C’s basic (built-in) types: int and float. (We've
also seen _Bool. which is a basic type in C99.) This chapter describes the rest of

the basic types and discusses important issues about types in general. Section 7.1
reveals the full range of integer types. which include_

andrunsignedrintegers: Section 7.2 introduces the

  
 

  

 

ection 7.3 covers the char type, which we'll need in order to work with charac-
ter data. Section 7.4 tackles the thorny topic of converting à value of one type to an
equivalent value of another. Section 7.5 shows how to use typedef to define new
type names. Finally, Section 7.6 describes the sizeoË£ operator. which measures
the amount of storage required for a type.

Integer Types

C supports two fundamentally different kinds of numeric types: integer types and
floating types. Values of an integer type are whole numbers, while values of a

floating type can have a fractional part as well. Theinteger types, in tum, are
