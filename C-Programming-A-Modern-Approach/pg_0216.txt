9.2  Function Declarations 191

return O0;

}

Notice that main contains a variable named n even though is prime’s
parameter 1s also named n. In general, a function may declare a variable with the
same name as a variable in another function. The two variables represent different
locations in memory, so assigning a new value to one variable doesn’t change the
other. (This property extends to parameters as well.) Section 10.1 discusses this
point in more detail.

Âs is_prime demonstrates, a function may have more than one return
statement. However, we can execute just one of these statements during a given
call of the function, because reaching a return statement causes the function to
return to where it was called. We’1l learn more about the return statement in
Section 9.4.

double x, y, Z;

scanf ("%1£%1£%1f", &X, &Y, E&Z);

print£ ("Average of %g and %g: %g\n", y, z, average(y, Zz));
print£ ("Average of %g and %g: %g\n"', x, z, average(x, z))

double average (double a, double b)

return (a + b) / 2;
