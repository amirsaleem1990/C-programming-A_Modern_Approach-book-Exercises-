Row sums: 34 34 34 34
Column sums: 34 34 34 34
Diagonal sums: 34 34

If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this example). the
numbers are said to form a magic square. The mugic square shown here appears in a 1514
engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht Dürer. (Note that the middle numbers in the
last row give the date of the engraving.)

Modify the addfrac. c program of Section 3.2 so that the user enters both fractions at the
same time, separated by à plus sign:

Enter two fractions separated by a plus sign: 5/6+3/4
The sum is 38/24
