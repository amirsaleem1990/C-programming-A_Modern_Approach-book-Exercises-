The following (rather confusing) function finds the median of three numbers. Rewrite the
function so that it has just one return statement.

double median (double x, double y, double Zz)

{

if (x <= y)
iËf (y <= z) return y;
else if (x <= z) return z;
else return x;

if (z <= y) return y;

if (x <= z) return x;

return z;

}

Condense the fact function in the same way we condensed power.
Rewrite the £act function so that il’s no longer recursive.

Write à recursive version of the gcd function (see Exercise 3). Here's the strategy to use for
computing gcd(m, n): If n is O, return m. Otherwise. call gcd] recursively. passing n as
the first argument and m % n as the second.

Consider the following “mystery” function:

void pb(int n)

{

if (n != 0O) |
pb(n / 2);
putchar ('0' + n % 2);

}
}

Trace the execution of the function by hand. Then write a program that calls the function,
passing it a number entered by the user. What does the function do?

Programming Projects

Write a program that asks the user to enter à scries of integers (which it stores in an array),
then sorts the integers by calling the function selection _sort. When given an array
With 7 elements. selection_sort must do the following:

|. Search the array to find the largest element. then move it to the last position in the array.
2. Call itself recursively to sort the first n — | elements of the array.
