Pointers

When passed an array a of length n. the function will search a for its largest and second-
largest elements, storing them in the variables pointed to by largest and
second _largest, respectively.

Write the following function:

void split date(int day _ of year, int year,
int *month, int *day) ;

day_of year is an integer between ! and 366, specifying a particular day within the year
designated by year. month and day point to variables in which the function will store the
equivalent month (1—12) and day within that month (1=31).

Write the following function:
int *find _ largest (int a[], int n);

When passed an array a of length n. the function will return à pointer to the array’s largest
element.

Programming Projects

Modify Programming Project 7 from Chapter 2 so that it includes the following function:

void pay_amount (int dollars, int *twenties, int *tens,
int *fives, int *ones) ;

The function determines the smallest number of $20, $10. $5, and $1 bills necessary to pay
the amount represented by the dollars parameter. The twenties parameter points to à
variable in which the function will store the number of S20 bills required. The tens,
fives. and ones parameters are similar.

Modify Programming Project 8 from Chapter 5 so that it includes the following function:

void find closest flight (int desired time,
int *departure time,
int *arrival time) ;

This function will find the flight whose departure time is closest to desired _time
(expressed in minutes since midnight). Ît will store the departure and arrival times of this
flight (also expressed in minutes since midnight) in the variables pointed to by
departure _ time andarrival time, respectively.

Modify Programming Project 3 from Chapter 6 so that it includes the following function:

void reduce (int numerator, int denominator,
int *reduced _ numerator,
int *reduced _denominator) ;

numerator and denominator areë the numerator and denominator of a fraction.
reduced_numerator and reduced_denominator are pointers to variables in
which the function will store the numerator and denominator of the fraction once it has been
reduced to lowest terms.

Modify the poker .c program of Section 10.5 by moving all external variables into main
and modifying functions so that they communicate by passing arguments. The
analyze_hand function nécds to change the straight, flush, four, three, and
pairs variables, so it will have to be passed pointers to those variables.
