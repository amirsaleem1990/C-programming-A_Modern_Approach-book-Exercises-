Is it legal for a function £1 to call a function f2, which then calls f1?

Yes. This is just an indirect form of recursion in which one call of f1 leads to
another. (But make sure that either £1 or £2 eventually terminates!)

Exercises

The following l'unction, which computes the area of a triangle. contains two errors. Locate
the errors and show how to fix them. (Hinr: There are no errors in the formula.)

double triangle_area (double base, height)
double product ;

{

product = base * height ;
return product / 2;

}

Write a function check (x, y, n) that returns | if both x and y fall between O and n = 1.
inclusive. The function should return O otherwise. Assume that x, y. and n are all of type
int.

Write a function gcd (m, n) that calculates the greatest common divisor of the integers m
and n. (Programming Projeet 2 in Chapter 6 describes Euclid’s algorithm for computing the
GCD.)

Write à function day_o£ _ year (month, day, year) that returns the day of the year
(an integer between ! and 366) specified by the three arguments.

Write a function num_digits (n) that returns the number of digits in n (a positive inte-
ger). Hint: To determine the number of digits in a number n. divide it by 10 repeatedly.
When n reaches O, the number of divisions indicates how many digits n originally had.

Write a function digit (n, k) that returns the k digit (From the right) in n (a posi-
tive integer). For example, digit (829, 1) returns 9. digit (829, 2) returns 2. and
digit (829, 3) returns &, If K is greater than the number of digits in n, have the func-
tion return 0.

Suppose that the function £ has the following definition:
int f(int a, int b) { … }

Which of the following statements are legal? (Assume that i has type int and x has type
double.)

(a) i = f(83, 12);

(b) x = f(83, 12);

(c) i = f(3.15, 9.28);
(d) x = f(3.15, 9.28);
(e) f(83, 12);

Which of the following would be valid prototypes for à function that returns nothing and has
one double parameter?

(a) void £ (double x) ;
