G Loops

À program without a loop and a structured
variable isn’t worth writing.

Chapter 5 covered C”s selection statements, i£ and switch. This chapter intro-
duces C's iteration statements, which allow us to set up loops.

À loop 1s a statement whose job is to repeatedly execute some other statement
(the loop body). In C, every loop has a controlling expression. Each time the loop

cute.

 

The last two sections of this chapter are devoted to C features that are used in
conjunction with loops. Section 6.4 describes the break, continue. and goto

any statement within afunction. Section 6.5 covers the null statement, which can

be used to create loops with empty bodies.

 
 
   

6.1 The while Statement

Of all the ways to set up loops in C, the while statement is the simplest and most
fundamental. The while statement has the form
