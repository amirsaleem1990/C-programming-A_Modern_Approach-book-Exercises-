or 12. Any other roll is called the “point” and the game continues. On each subsequent roll,
the player wins if he or she rolls the point again. The player loses by rolling 7. Any other roll
is Ignored and the game continues. At the end of each game, the program will ask the user
whether or not to play again. When the user enters à response other than y or Y. the program
Will display the number of wins and losses and then terminate.

You rolled: 8
Your point is 8
You rolled: 3
You rolled: 10
You rolled: 8
You win!

Play again? y

You rolled: 6
Your point is 6
You rolled: 5
You rolled: 12
You rolled: 3
You rolled: 7
You lose!

Play again? y

You rolled: 11
You win!

Play again? n
Wins: 2  Losses: 1

Write your program as three functions: main, roll_dice. and play_game. Here are
the prototypes for the latter two functions:

int roll dice (void) ;
bool play game (void) ;

roll _dice should gcnerate two random numbers, each between ! and 6, and return their
sum. play_game should play one craps game (calling ro1l l_dice to determine the out-
come of each dice roll); it will return true if the player wins and fa1 se if the player loses.
play_game is also responsible for displaying messages showing the results of the player's
dice rolls. main will call play _game repeatedly. keeping track of the number of wins and
losses and displaying the “you win” and “you lose” messages. Hint: Use the rand function
to génerate random numbers. See the deal .c program in Section 8.2 for an example of
how to call rand and the related srand function.
