16.1  Structure Variables 379

Usually it’s not necessary to draw structures in such detail. l'Il normally show
them more abstractly, as a series of boxes:

number
naine

on_hand

] may sometimes draw the boxes horizontally instead of vertically:

001

number s/ name on hand

 

Member values will go in the boxes later; for now, l’ve left them emply.

Each structure represents à new scope: any names declared in that scope won t
conflict with other names in a program. (In C terminology. we say that cach struc-
ture has à separate name space for its members.) For example, the following decla-
rations can appear in the same program:

struct |
int number;
char name [NAME LEN+1] ;
int on hand;

} partl, part2:;

struct (
char name [NAME LEN+1] ;
int number;
char sex;

} employeel, employee2;

The number and name members in the part1 and part2 structures don't con-
flict with the number and name members in employeel and employee2.

Initializing Structure Variables

Like an array, à structure variable may be initialized at the time it’s declared. To
initialize à structure, we prepare a list of valucs to be stored in the structure and
enclose 11 in braces:

struct {
int number ;
char name [NAME _ LEN+1}] ;
int on hand;
} part1 = {528, "Disk drive"”, 10},
part2 = {914, "Printer cable", 5};
