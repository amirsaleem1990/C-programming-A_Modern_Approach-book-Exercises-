6.4  Exiting from a Loop 113

n = 0;

sum = Q0;

while (n < 10) |
scan£("%$d", &i) ;

L£ (i == O)

continue ;
sum += ji;
n++;

/* continue jumps to here */

}

If continue were not available, we could have written the example as follows:

n = 0;
sum = O0;
vhile (n < 10) {
scanf ("td", &i);
if (i != O) |
sum += i;
n++ ;

)

goto statement

 

If C didn’t have a break statement, here’s how we might use a goto state-
ment Lo exit prematurely from a loop:

for (d = 2; d < n; d++)
if (n Ÿ d == O)
goto done ;
