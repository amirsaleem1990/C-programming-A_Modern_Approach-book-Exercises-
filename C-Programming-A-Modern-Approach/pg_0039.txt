return value of main >9,5

compound statement » 5.2

The statement
return 0;

has two effects: it causes the main function to terminate (thus ending the program)
and it indicates that the main function returns a value of 0. We'I1 have more to say
about main’s return value in a later chapter. For now, we’Il always have main
return the value O, which indicates normal program termination.

If there's no return statement at the end of the main function. the program
will still terminate. However, many compilers will produce a warning message
(because the function was supposed to return an integer but failed to).

Statements /

À statement is a command to be exccuted when the program runs. We*Il explore
statements later in the book. primarily in Chapters 5 and 6. The pun. c program
uses only two kinds of statements. One is the return statement: the other is the

function call. Asking a function to perform its assigned task is known as calling

the function. The pun . c program, for example, calls the printf function to dis-
play a string on the screen:

print£f ("To C, or not to C: that is the question.\n") ;

 

Printing Strings

printf is a powerful function that we*Il examine in Chapter 3. So far. we've only
used print£ to display a string literal—a series of characters enclosed in double
quotation marks. When print£ displays a string literal, it doesn’t show the quo-
tation marks.

  

Writing a new-line character termi-
& current output line; subsequent output goes onto the next line. To illus-
trate this point, consider the effect of replacing the statement

 

printf ("To C, or not to C: that is the question. \n") ;
by two calls of print£:

printf("To C, or not to C: ");
print£f ("that is the question.\n") ;
