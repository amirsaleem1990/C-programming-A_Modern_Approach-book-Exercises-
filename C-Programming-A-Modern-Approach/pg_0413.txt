Chapter 16  Structures, Unions, and Enumerations

To access onc of the parts in the array, we’d use subscripting. To print the part
stored in position i, for example, we could write

print part (inventory [i] ) ;

Accessing à member within a part structure requires a combination of sub-
scripting and member selection. To assign 883 to the number member of
inventory [i]. we could write

inventory [i] .number = 883;

Accessing a single character in a part name requires subscripting (to select a par-
ticular part), followed by selection (to select the name member). followed by sub-
scripting (to select a character within the part name). To change the name stored in
inventory [i] to an empty string, we could write

inventory [i] .name [(0] = '\0';

Initializing an Array of Structures

Initializing an array of structures is done in much the same way as initializing a
multidimensional array. Each structure has its own brace-enclosed initializer; the
initalizer for the array simply wraps another set of braces around the structure ini-
tializers.

One reason for initializing an array of structures is that we‘re planning to treat
it as a database of information that won't change during program execution. For
example. suppose that we're working on a program that will need access to the
country codes used when making international telephonc calls. First. we*Il set up a
structure that can store the name of a country along with its code:

struct dialing code {
char *country;
int code;

} z

Note that country 1s a pointer, not an array of characters. That could be a prob-
lem if we were planning to use dialing_code structures as variables. but we're
not. When we initialize a dialing _ code structure, country will end up
pointing to a string literal.

Next, wc'Il declare an array of these structures and initialize it to contain the
codes for some of the world’s most populous nations:

const struct dialing_code country codes[] =

{{'Argentina", 54}, {"Bangladesh", 880},
{"Brazil", 55}, {"Burma (Myanmar)", 95},
{"China", 86}, {"Colombia", 57},
{"Congo, Dem. Rep. of", 243}, {"Egypt", 20},
{"Ethiopia", 251}, {"France", 33},
{"Germany", 49}, {"India", 91},
