Calculating a Broker’s Commission

When stocks are sold or purchased through a broker, the broker’s commission 1s
often computed using à sliding scale that depends upon the value of the stocks
traded. Let's say that a broker charges the amounts shown in the following table:

Transaction size
Under $2,500
$2,500-$6,250
$6,250-$20,000
$20.000-$50,000

$50,000-$500,000

Over $500,000

Commission rate
$30 + 1.7%

$56 + 0.66%
476 + 0.34%
$100 + 0.22%
$155 + 0.11%
$255 + 0.09%

The minimum charge is $39. Our next program asks the user to enter the amount of
the trade, then displays the amount of the commission:

Enter value of trade:
Commission: $166.00

30000

The heart of the program is a cascaded i £ statement that determines which range
the trade falls into.
