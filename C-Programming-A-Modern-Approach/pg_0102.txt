compound statement

5.2 The if Statement 77

When an i f statement is executed, the expression in the parentheses 1s evalu-
ated; if the value of the expression is nonzero—which C interprets as true—the
statement after the parentheses is executed. Here’s an example:

if (line num == MAX LINES)
line num = O0;

The statement line num = 0; is executed if the condition line num ==
MAX LINES is true (has a nonzero value).

 

Don’t confuse == (equality) with = (assignment). The statement
if (i == O)

tests whether i is equal to 0. However, the statement

i£ (ài = O)

assigns 0 to i, then tests whether the result is nonzero. In this case, the test always
fails.

Confusing == with = is perhaps the most common C programming error,
probably because = means “is equal to” in mathematics (and in certain program-
ming languages). Some compilers issue a warning if they notice = where == would
normally appear.

 

Ofiten the expression in an if statement will test whether a variable falls
within a range of values. To test whether O € i < n, for example, we’d write

if (O <= 1 & i < n)
To test the opposite condition (i is outside the range), we'd write
if (i < O || i >= n)

Note the use of the | | operator instead of the && operator.

Compound Statements
In our i f statement template, notice that statement is singular, not plural:
if ( expression ) statement

What if we want an i f statement to control Avo or more statements? That’s where
the compound statement comes in. A compound statement has the form

{ statements }

By putting braces around a group of statements, we can force the compiler to treal
it as a single statement.
