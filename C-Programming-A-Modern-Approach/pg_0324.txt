p 1s then incremented as long as it doesn’t point to a null character. When the loop
terminates, p must be pointing to the null character:

Y. _

The second while stalement implements step (2). The loop body copies one
character from where s2 points to where p points, then increments both p and s2.
If s2 originally points to the string "def", here’s what the strings will look like
after the first loop iteration:

81[Î_| ‘°Î%J sp.[__{:|

a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The loop terminates when s2 points to the null character:

|w|ca[e]e] [a [ î1‘îﬁ

After putting à null character where p is pointing, strcat returns.
By a process similar to the one we used for strlen, we can condense the
definition of strcat, arriving at the following version:

 

 

 

char *strcat (char *s1, const char *s2)

{

char *p = sl;

while (*p)
p++;
while (*p++ = #*s2++)

return sl;
