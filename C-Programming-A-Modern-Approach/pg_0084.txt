4.2  Assignment Operators 59

 

 

Side Effects

We don’t normally expect operators to modify their operands, since operators in
mathematics don’t. Writing i + j doesn't modify either i or ;; it simply computes
the result of adding i and .

Most C operators don’t modify their operands, but some do. We say that these
operators have side effects, since they do more than just compute a value. The
simple assignment operator is the first operator we'’ve seen that has side effects; it
modifies its left operand. Evaluating the expression i = O produces the result O
and—as a side effect—assigns 0 to i.

Lvalues

Most C operators allow their operands to be variables, constants, or expressions
containing other operators. The assignment operator, however, requires an lvalne
