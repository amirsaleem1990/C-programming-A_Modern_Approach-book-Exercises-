Âre the following i £ statements equivalent? Tf not, why not?

LËÉ (score >= 90)
print£ ("A") ;

else if (score >= 80)
print£f("B") ;

else if (score >= ”70)
printf ("C") ;

else if (score >= 60)
print£ ("D") ;

else
print£f("F") ;

if (score < 60)
print£f("F") ;

else if (score < ”70)
printf ("D") ;

else if (score < 80)
printf ("C") ;

else if (score < 90)
print£ ("B") ;

else
print£ ("A") ;

What output does the following program fragment produce? (Assume that i is an integer
variable.)

i = 1;

switch (i % 3) |
case 0: printf ("zero") ;
case 1: printf ("one") ;
case 2: printf ("two") ;

}

The following table shows telephone arca codes in the state of Georgia along with the larg-
est city in each area:

Areacode = Major city
229 Albany
404 Atlanta
470 Atlanta
478 Macon
678 Atlanta
706 Columbus
162 Columbus
710 Atlanta
912 Savannah

Write a switch statement whose controlling expression is the variable area_code. If the
value of area_code 1s in the table, the switch statement will print the corresponding
city name. Otherwise, the switch statement will display the message "Area code not
recognized". Use the techniques discussed in Section 5.3 to make the switch state-
ment as simple as possible.

Write a program that calculates how many digits a number contains:

Enter a number: 374
The number 374 has 3 digits

You may assume that the number has no more than four digits. Hint: Use i£ statements to
test the number. For example, if the number is between O and 9, it has one digit. If the num-
ber is between 10 and 99, it has two dieits.
