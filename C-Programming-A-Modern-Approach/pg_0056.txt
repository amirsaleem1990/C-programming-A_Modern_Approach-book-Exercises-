Q: How can I tell if my program has an unterminated comment?
À

If you’re lucky, the program won’t compile because the comment has rendered the
program 1llegal. If the program does compile, there are several techniques that you
can use. Stepping through the program line by line with a debugger will reveal if
any lines are being skipped. Some IDESs display comments in a distinctive color to
distinguish them from surrounding code. If you’re using such an environment, you
can easily spot unterminated comments, since program text will have a different

lint>12  COlor if it’s accidentally included in a comment. À program such as lint can also
help.
