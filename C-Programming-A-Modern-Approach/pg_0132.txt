= Counting up from 0 to n-1:
idiom for (i = O0; i < n; i++)
= Counting up fron 1 ton:
idiom for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
= Counting down from nl to 0:
idiom for (i=n-1; i >= 0; i--)
= Counting down from n to 1:
idiom for (i = n; 1 > 0O; i--)

Imitating these patterns will help you avoid some of the following errors,
which beginning C programmers often make:

u Using < instead of > (or vice versa) in the controlling expression. Notice that
“counting up” loops use the < or <= operator, while “counting down” loops
rely on > Or >=.

u Using == in the controlling expression instead of <, <=. >, Or >=. À control-
ling expression needs to be true at the beginning of the loop, then later become
false so that the loop can terminate. À test such as i == n doesn’t make much
sense, because it won°t be true initially.

m ‘“Off-by-one” errors such as writing the controlling expression as i <= n
instead of i < n.
