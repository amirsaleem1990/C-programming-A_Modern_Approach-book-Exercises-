Introducing C

When someone says "| want a programming language in which
| need only say what | wish done," give him a lollipop.*

What is C? The simple answer—a widely used programming language developed
in the early 1970s at Bell Laboratories—conveys little of C*s special flavor. Before
we become immersed in the details of the language, let's take a look at where C
came from, what it was designed for, and how it has changed over the years (Sec-
tion 1.1). We'Il also discuss Cs strengths and weaknesses and see how to get the
most out of the language (Section 1.2).

History of C

Let's take a quick look at C’s history, from its origins, to its coming of age as a
standardized language, to its influence on recent languages.

Origins

C is a by-product of the UNIX operating system, which was developed at Bell Lab-
oratories by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Thompson single-hand-
edly wrote the original version of UNIX, which ran on the DEC PDP-7 computer,
an early minicomputer with only 8K words of main memory (this was 1969. after
all!). ,
Like other operating systems of the time, UNIX was written in assembly lan-
guage. Programs written in assembly language are usually painful to debug and
hard to enhance; UNIX was no exception. Thompson decided that a higher-level
