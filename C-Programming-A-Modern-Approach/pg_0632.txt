Besides additional versions of ceil and floor. C99 has a number of new func-
tions that convert a floating-point value to the nearest integer. Be careful when
using these functions: although all of them return an integer, some functions
return it in floating-point format (as a float, double, or long double
value) and some return it in integer format (as a long int or long long int
value).

The nearbyint function rounds its argument to an integer, returning it as a
floating-point number. nearbyint uses the current rounding direction and does
not raise the inexaci floating-point exception. rint is the same as nearbyint,
except that it may raise the inexact floating-point exception if the result has a dif-
ferent value than the argument.

The Lrint function rounds its argument to the nearest integer, according to
the current rounding direction. 1rint returns a long int value. 11rint is the
same as 1rint, except that it returns a long long int value.

The round function rounds its argument to the nearest integer value, return-
ing It as a floating-point number. round always rounds away from zero (so 3.5 is
rounded to 4.0, for example).
