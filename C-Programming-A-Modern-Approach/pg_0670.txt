TA three-letter abbreviation followed by a separator (often a space or à period). For example, the
international currency symbols for Switzerland. the United Kingdom. and the United States are
"CHF "."GBP ",and "USD ", respectively,

Each character in these strings specifies the size of one group of digits. (Grouping
takes place from right to left, starting at the decimal point.) À value of CHAR MAX
indicates that no further grouping is to be performed; O indicates that the previous
clement should be used for the remaining digits. For example, the string "\3" (\3
followed by \0O) indicates that the first group should have 3 digits. then all other
digits should be grouped in 3's as well.

The char members of the 1conv structure are divided into two groups. The
members of the first group (Table 25.2) affect the /ocal formatting of monetary
quantities. The members of the second group (Table 25.3) affect the international
formatting of monetary quantities. AIl but one of the members in Table 25.3 were
added in C99. As Tables 25.2 and 25.3 show, the value of each char member in
the "C" locale is CHAR MAX, which means “not available.”

frac _ digits CHAR MAX — Number of digits after decimal point

p cs precedes CHAR MAX — lifcurrency_symbol precedes
nonnegative quantity; O 1f it succeeds quantity

n cs precedes CHAR MAX — li/Currency_symbol precedes negative
quantity: O 1f it succeeds quantity

p_sep _ by _ space … CHAR MAX — Separation of currency_symbol and sign
string from nonnegative quantity (see Table
25.4)

n sep by space — CHAR MAX _ Scparation of currency_symbol and sign
string from negative quantity (see Table 25.4)

p sign posn CHAR MAX — Position of positive sign for
nonnegative quantity (see Table 25.5)
n_sign posn CHAR MAX _ Position ofnegative sign for negative
