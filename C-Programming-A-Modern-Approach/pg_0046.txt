int height, length, width, volume, weight;

height = 8B;
length = 12;
width = 10;

volume = height * length * width;
weight = (volume + 165) / 166;

printf ("Dimensions: %dx%dx%*d\n", length, width, heïight) ;
printf ("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n", volume) ;
printf ("Dimensional weight (pounds): *d\n", weight) ;

return 0;

The output of the program 1s

Dimensions: 12x10x8
Volume (cubic inches): 960
Dimensional weight (pounds): 6

Initialization

 

 

Attempting to access the value of an uninitialized variable (for example, by dis-
playing the variable using print£ or using il in an expression) may yield an
unpredictable result such as 2568, —30891, or some equally strange number. With
some compilers, worse behavior—even a program crash—may occur.

 

We can always give a variable an initial value by using assignment. of course.
But there’s an easier way: put the initial value of the variable in its declaration. For
example, we can declare the height variable and initialize it in one step:
