_Ul

Ignorc all characters that arenâ€™t letters. Use integer variables to keep track of positions in the

Simplify Programming Project 1(b) by taking advantage of the fact that an array name can
be used as a pointer.

Simplify Programming Project 2(b) by taking advantage of the fact that an airay name can
be used as a pointer.

Modify Programming Project 14 from Chapter 8 so that it uses a pointer instead of an inte-
ger to keep track of the current position in the array that contains the sentence.

Modify the gsort . c program of Section 9.6 so that 1ow, high, and middle are pointers
lo array clements rather than integers. The split function will need to return a pointer. not
