tity on hand to a file. (Don't save the next pointer: it won’t be valid once the program ter-
minates.) As it reads parts from a file, the r operation will rebuild the list one node at a time.

Write a program that reads a date from the command line and displays it in the following
form:

September 13, 2010

Allow the user to enter the date as either 9-13-2010 or 9/13/2010; you may assume
that there are no spaces in the date. Print an error message if the date doesn’t have one of the
specified forms. Hinr: Use sscanf to extract the month, day, and year from the command-
line argument.

Modify Programming Project 2 from Chapter 3 so that the program rcads a series of items
from a file and displays the data in columns. Each line of the file will have the following
form:

item, price, mm/dd/yyyy
For example, suppose that the file contains the following lines:

583,13.5,10/24/2005
3912,599.99,7/27/2008

The output of the program should have the following appearance:

Item Unit Purchase
Price Date

583 $ 13.50 10/24/2005

3912 S 599.99 7/27/2008

Have the program obtain the file name from the command line.

Modify Programming Project 8 from Chapter 5 so that the program obtains departure and
arrival times from a file named flights.dat. Each line of the file will contain a depar-
ture time followed by an arrival time, with one or more spaces separating the two. Times
will be expressed using the 24-hour clock. For example, here’s what £lights . dat might
look like 1f it contained the flight information listed in the original project:

8:00 10:16

9:43 11:52

11:19 13:31
12:47 15:00
14:00 16:08
15:45 17:55
19:00 21:20
21:45 23:58

Modify Programming Project 15 from Chapter & so that the program prompts the user to
enter the name of a file containing the message to be encrypted:

Enter name of file to be encrypted: message.txt
Enter shift amount (1-25): 3

 

The program then writes the encrypted message lo a file with the same name but an added
extension of .enc. In this example, the original file name is message.txt, so the
encrypted message will be stored in a file named message. txt .enc. There’s no limit on
the size of the file to be encrypted or on the length of each line in the file.

Modify the justi fy program of Section 15.3 so that it reads from one text file and writes
to another. Have the program obtain the names of both files from the command line.
