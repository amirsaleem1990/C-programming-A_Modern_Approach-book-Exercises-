Program Organization

As Will Rogers would have said, â€œThere
is no such thing as a free variable."

Having covered functions in Chapter 9, we*re ready to confront several issues that
arise when a program contains more than one function. The chapter begins with a
discussion of the differences between local variables (Section 10.1) and external
variables (Section 10.2). Section 10.3 then considers blocks (compound statements
containing declarations). Section 10.4 tackles the scope rules that apply to local
names, external names, and names declared in blocks. Finally, Section 10.5 sug-
gests a way to organize function prototypes, f'unction definitions, variable declara-
tions, and the other parts of a C program.

Local Variables

Ã€ variable declared in the body of a function is said to be /ocal to the function. In
the following function, sum 1s a local variable:

int sum digits (int n)

{
int sum = O0; /* local variable */
while (n > O) Ã‡
sum += n % 10;
n /= 10;
}
return sum;
}
