246 Chapter 11  Pointers

*p = l;
p\î:l
1 i
//
q «
*q = 2;

 

 

Any number of pointer variables may point to the same object.
Be careful not to confuse

q = P/
with
*q = *P;

The first statement is a pointer assignment; the second isnt, as the followine
example shows:

 

 

p = &i;
q =€&j;
i = 1;
00

GO
[H

The assignment *q = *p copies the value that p points to (the value of i) into the
object that q points to (the variable ).
