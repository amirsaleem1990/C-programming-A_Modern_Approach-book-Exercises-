214  The <stddef .h> Header: Common Definitions 535

Boolean Type and Values

Defines the boo1, true, and f alse macros, as well as a macro that can be used
to test whether these macros have been defined.

Integer Types

Declares integer types with specified widths and defines related macros (such as
macros that specify the maximum and minimum values of each type). Also defines
parameterized macros that construct integer constants with specific types.

Type-Generic Math

In C99, there are multiple versions of many math functions in the <math.h> and
<complex.h> headers. The “type-generic” macros in <tgmath.h> can detect
the types of the arguments passed Lo them and substitute a call of the appropriate
<math.h> or <complex.h> function.

Extended Multibyte and Wide-Character Utilities

Provides functions for wide-character input/output and wide string manipulation.

Wide-Character Classification and Mapping Utilities

The wide-character version of <ctype.h>. Provides functions for classifying
and changing the case of wide characters.

The <stddef .h> Header: Common Definitions

The <stdde£ .h> header provides definitions of frequently used types and mac-
ros; it doesn’t declare any functions. The types are:

u ptrdiff t. The type of the result when two pointers are subtracted.

u size t. The type returned by the sizeoË£ operator.

u wchar t. À type large enough to represent all possible characters in all sup-
ported locales.

A11 three are names for integer types: ptrdiff t must be a signed type, while
size t must be an unsigned type. For more information about wchar t, see
Section 25.2.

The <stddef .h> header also defines two macros. One of them is NULL,
which represents the null pointer. The other macro, of fsetof, requires two argu-
ments: /ype (a structure type) and rmember-designator (à member of the structure).
