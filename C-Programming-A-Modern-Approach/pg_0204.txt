Modify the reverse.c program of Section 8.1 to use the expression (int)
(sizeof (a) / sizeof (a [0] )) (or a macro with this value) for the array length.

Modify the interest .c program of Section 8.1 so that it compounds interest monrhly
instead of annually. The form of the output shouldn't change: the balance should still be
shown at annual intervals.

The prototypical Internet newbie is a fellow named B1FF, who has a unique way of writine
messages. Here’s a typical B1FF communiqué:
H3Y DUD3, C 15 RI1ILLY COOL!!! ! ! E! !!!

Write a “B1FF filter* that reads a message entered by the user and translates it into B1FF-
speak:

Enter message: Hey dude, C is rilly cool
In B1FF-speak: H3Y DUD3, C 15 R1LLY COOL! ! !! !! ! 111

 

Your program should convert the message to upper-case letters, substitute digits for certain
letters (A>4, B>8, E>3, I>1, O>0, S>5), and then append 10 or so exclamation marks.
Hint: Store the original message in an array of characters, then go back through the array,
transiating and printing characters one by one.

Write a program that reads a 5 x 5 array of integers and then prints the row sums and the
column sums:

 

 

 

 

Enter row 1: 8 3 9 O 10
Enter row 2: 3 5 17 1 1l
Enter row 3: 2 B 6 23 l
Enter row 4: 15 7 3 2 9
Enter row 5: 6 14 2 6 0

 

Row totals: 30 27 40 36 28
Column totals: 34 37 37 32 21

Modify Programming Project 7 so that it prompts for five quiz grades for each of five stu-
dents, then computes the total score and average score for each student, and the average
score, high score, and low score for cach quiz.

Write a program that generates à ‘“random walk” across a 10 x 10 array. The array will con-
tain characters (all * . * initially). The program must randomly “walk” from element to ele-
ment, always going up, down. left. or right by one element. The elements visited by the
program will be labeled with the letters A through Z, in the order visited. Herc's an example
of the destred output:

A ..
B CLD
F E
H G
Ï .
J ‘ . à
K..RsTUVY
LMPO Wx
N O

Hint: Use the srand and rand functions (see deal .c) to generate random numbers.
After senerating a number, look at its remainder when divided by 4. There are four possible
values for the remainder—0, !. 2, and 3—indicating the direction of the next move. Before
performing a move. check that (a) it won’t go outside the array, and (b) it doesn't take us to
