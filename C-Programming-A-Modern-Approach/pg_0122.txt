2:00 p.m. 4+:08 p.m.
3:45 p.m. 5:55 p.m.
7:00 p.m. 9:20 p.m.
9:45 p.m. 11:58 p.m.

Write à program that asks user to enter a time (expressed in hours and minutes, using the 24-
hour clock). The program then displays the departure and arrival times for the Might whose
departure time is closest to that entered by the user:

Enter a 24-hour time: 13:15
Closest departure time is 12:47 p.m., arriving at 3:00 p.m.

Hint: Convert the input inlo à time expressed in minutes since midnight. and compare it to
the departure times, also expressed in minutes since midnight. For example, 13:15 is 13 x
60 + 15 = 795 minutes since midnight, which is closer to 12:47 p.m. (767 minutes since
midnight) than to any of the other departure times.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two dates and then indicates which date
comes earlier on the calendar:

Enter first date (mm/dd/yy): 3/6/08
Enter second date (mm/dd/yy) : 5/17/07
5/17/07 is earlier than 3/6/08

Using the switch statement. write a program that converts a numerical grade into a letter
grade:

Enter numerical grade: 84
Letter grade: B

Use the following grading scale: À = 90-100, B = 80-89, C = 70-79, D = 60-69. F = 0-59.
Print an error message if the grade is larger than 100 or less than O. Hint: Break the grade
into two digits, then use a switch statement to test the ten’s digit.

Write a program that asks the user for a two-digit number. then prints the English word for
the number:

Enter a two-digit number: 45
You entered the number forty-five.

Hint: Break the numnber into two digits. Use one switch statement to print the word for the
first digit (“twenty” “thirty,” and so forth). Use a second switch statement to print the
word for the second digit. Don’t forget that the numbers between !! and 19 require special
treatment.
