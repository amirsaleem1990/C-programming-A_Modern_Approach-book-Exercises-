Table 25.13

Wide-String Numeric
Conversion Functions and
Their <stdlib.h>
Equivalents

25.5  The <wchar.h> Header (C99) 663

unsigned long int wcstoul(

const wchar t * restrict nptr,
wchar t ** restrict endptr,
int base) ;

unsigned long long int wcstoull(

const wchar t * restrict nptr,
wchar t ** restrict endptr,
int base) ;

The functions in this group are wide-character versions of the numeric conversion
functions found in <stdlib. h> and described in Scction 26.2. The <wchar .h>
functions have arguments of type wchar_t * and wchar t ** instead of char
* and char **, but their behavior is mostly the same as the <stdlib.h> func-
tions. Table 25.13 shows the correspondence between the <stdlib. h> functions

and their wide-character counterparts.

The functions in this group are wide-character versions of the string copying func-
tions found in <string.h> and described in Section 23.6. The <wchar.h>
functions have arguments oftype wchar t * instead of char *, but their behavior
is mostly the same as the <string.h> functions. Table 25.14 shows the corre-
spondence between the <string .h> functions and their wide-character counter-

parts.
