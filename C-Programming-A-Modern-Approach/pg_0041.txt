Chapter2 C Fundamentals

the comment ends. Putting * / on a line by itself helps:

/* Name: pun.c
Purpose: Prints a bad pun.
Author: K. N. King

*/
Even better, we can form a “box” around the comment to make it stand out:

/************************‘k*‘k**‘k‘k*********‘k******‘k**********

* Name: pun.c *
* Purpose: Prints a bad pun. *
* Author: K. N. King *

*******‘k******‘k*********‘k*******************‘k*****‘k*******/

Programmers often simplify boxed comments by omitting three of the sides:

/*
* Name: pun.c
* Purpose: Prints a bad pun.
* Author: K. N. King

*/
À short comment can go on the same line with other program code:
int main (void) /* Beginning of main program */

À comment like this 185 sometimes called a “winged comment.”

 

Forgetting to terminate a comment may cause the compiler to ignore part of your
program. Consider the following example:

print£ ("My ") ; /* forgot to close this comment...
print£ ("cat ") ;
print£ ("has ") ; /* so it ends here */

print£ ("fleas") ;

Because we’ve neglected to terminate the first comment, the compiler ignores the
middle two statements, and the example prints My fleas.

 

C99 provides a second kind of comment, which begins with // (two adjacent
slashes):

 

// Name: pun.c
// Purpose: Prints a bad pun.
// Author: K. N. King
