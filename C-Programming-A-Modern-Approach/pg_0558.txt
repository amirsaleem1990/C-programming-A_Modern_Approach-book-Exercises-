make it possible to jump from one function into another, still-active function.
bypassing the normal function-return mechanism, setjmp and Iongjmp are
used primarily for handling serious problems that arise during program execution.

Signal Handling

Provides functions that deal with exceptional conditions (signals), including inter-
rupts and run-time errors. The signal function installs a l'unction to be called if a
given signal should occur later. The rai se function causes a signal to occur.

Variable Arguments

Provides tools for writing functions that, like print£f and scan£, can have a
variable number of arguments.

Common Definitions

Provides definitions of frequently used types and macros.

Input/Ouiput

Provides a large assortment of input/output functions. including operations on both
scquential and random-access files.

General Utilities

A “catchall* header for functions that don't fit into any of the other headers. The
functions in this header can convert strings to numbers, generate pseudo-random
numbers. perform memory management tasks, communicate with the operating
system. do searching and sorting. and perform conversions between multibyte
characters and wide characters.

String Handling
Provides functions that perform string operations, including copying, concatena-

tion, comparison, and searching, as well às functions that operate on arbitrary
blocks of memory.

Date and Time

Provides functions for determining the time (and date), manipulating times, and
formatting times for display.
