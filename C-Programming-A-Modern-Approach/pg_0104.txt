52  The if Statement 79

There are no restrictions on what kind of statements can appear inside an if
statement. In fact. it’*s not unusual for i£ statements to be nested inside other i f
statements. Consider the following i f statement, which finds the largest of the
numbers stored in i, j, and k and stores that value in max:

if (i > 7)
if (i > k)
max = i;
else
max = kK;
else
if (j > k)
max = ];
else
max = k;

i f statements can be nested to any depth. Notice how aligning each e1se with the
matching i f makes the nesting easier to see. If you still find the nesting confusing,
don°t hesitate to add braces:

if (i > j) (|

if (i > k)
max = 1;
else
max = k;
} else |
if (j > K)
max = j;
else
max = k;

}

Adding braces to statements—even when they’re not necessary—is like using
parentheses in expressions: both techniques help make à program murè readable
while at the same time avoiding the possibility that the compiler won’t understand
the program the way we thought it did.

Some programmers use as many braces as possible inside i£ statements (and
iteration statements as well). À programmer who adopts this convention would
include à pair of braces for every i £ clause and every else clause:
if (i > j) |

if (i > Kk) |

max = i;
} else (
max = k;
}
} else {
if (j > k) |
max = ];
} else |
max = k;
}

}
