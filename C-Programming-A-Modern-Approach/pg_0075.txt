Programming Projects

Write a program that accepts a date from the user in the form »wn/dd/vyvy and then dis-
plays it in the form vyywmmdd:

Enter a date (mm/dd/yyyy) : 2/17/2011
You entered the date 20110217

Write a program that formats product information entered by the user. À session with the
program should look like this:

Enter item number: 583

Enter unit price: 13.5
Enter purchase date (mm/dd/yyyy) : 10/24/2010

 

Item Unit Purchase
Price Date
583 $ 13.50 10/24/2010

The item number and date should be left justified; the unit pricce should be right justified.
Allow dotlar amounts up to S9999.99. Hint: Use tabs to line up the columns.

Books are identified by an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). ISBNSs assigned
after January !, 2007 contain 13 digits, arranged in five groups, such as 978-0-393-97950-3.
(Older ISBNs use 10 digits.) The first group (the GS7 prefix) is currently either 978 or 9779.
The group identifier specifies the language or country of origin (for example. O and ! are
used in English-speaking countries). The publisher code identifies the publisher (393 is the
code for W. W. Norton). The irem number is assigned by the publisher to identify à specific
book (97950 is the code for this book). An ISBN ends with a check digit thats used to verify
the accuracy of the préceding digits. Write a program that breaks down an ISBN entered by
the user:

Enter ISBN: 978-0-393-97950-3
GS1 prefix: 978

Group identifier: O

Publisher code: 393

Item number: 97950

Check digit: 3

 

Note: The number of digits in cach group may vary: you cant assume that groups have the
lengths shown in this example. Test your program with actual ISBN values (usually found
on the back cover of à book and on the copyright page).

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a telephone number in the form (xxx) xxx-
XXxxx and then displays the number in the form xxX.Xxx.xxx:

Enter phone number [(xxx) xxx-xxxx}] : (404) 817-6900
You entered 404.817.6900

 

Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from | to 16 (in any order) and then
displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows, columns.
and ciagonals:

Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
16 3 2 13 5 10 11 896 7 12 & 15 18 1
