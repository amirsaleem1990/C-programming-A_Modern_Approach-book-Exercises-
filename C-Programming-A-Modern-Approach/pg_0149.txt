Programming Project 9 in Chapter 5 asked you to write a program that determines which of
two dates comes earlier on the calendar. Generalize the program so that the user may enter
any number of dates. The user will enter 0/0/0 to indicate that no more dates will be entered:

5/17/07

date (mm/dd/vy) : 3/6/08
date (mm/dd/yy): 5/17/07
date (mm/dd/yy) : 6/3/07
date (mm/dd/yy) : 0/0/0
is the earliest date

The value of the mathematical constant e can be expressed as an infinite series:
e=l+1/1!+1/2!+1/31 + ….

Write a program that approximates e by computing the value of

1+1/1!+ 1221 + 1/31 4 . + Vn!

where » is an integer entcred by the user.

Modify Programming Project 11 so that the program continues adding terms until the cur-
rent term becomes less than €, where € is a small (Moating-point) number entered by the

USEr.
