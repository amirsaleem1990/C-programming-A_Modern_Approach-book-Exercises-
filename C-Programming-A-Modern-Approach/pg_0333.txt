Do I have to use the names argc and argv for main’s parameters? [p. 302]

No. Using the names argc and argv is merely a convention, not a language
requirement.

l’ve seen argv declared as **argv instead of *argv []. Is this legal?
Certainly. When declaring a parameter, writing *a is always the same as writing
a [) . regardless of the type of a’s elements.

We”ve seen how to set up an array whose elements are pointers to string liter-
als. Are there any other applications for arrays of pointers?

Yes. Although we've focused on arrays of pointers to character strings. that’s not
the only application of arrays of pointers. We could just as easily have an array
whose elements point to any type of data, whether in array form or not. Arrays of
pointers are particularly useful in conjunction with dynamic storage allocation.

Exercises

The following function calls supposedly write a single new-line character. but some are
incorrect. Identify which calls don’t work and explain why.

(a) printf("%c", '\n'), (g) putchar ('\n') ;
(b) print£("%c", "\n") , (h) putchar ("\n") ;
(c) printf("%s", '\n'); (1) puts('\n') ;

(d) print£f("ss", "\n") ; ÿ) puts("\n") ;

(e) print£('\n'); (k) puts("") ;

() printf ("\n") ;

Suppose that p has been declared as follows:
char *p = "abc";

Which of the following function calls are legal? Show the output produced by each legal
call. and explain why the others are illegal.

(a) putchar (p) ;

(b) putchar (*p) ;

(c) puts (p) ;

(d) puts(*p) ;

Suppose that we call scan£ as follows:

scanf ("%d%s%d", &i, s, &j);

If the user enters 12abc34 56def£78, what will be the values of i, s, and j after the
call? (Assume that i and j are int variables and s is an array of characters.)

Modify the read_line function in each of the following ways:

(a) Have it skip white space before beginning to store input characters.

(b) Have it stop reading at the first white-space character. Hint: To determine whether or
not a character is white space, call the isspace function.
