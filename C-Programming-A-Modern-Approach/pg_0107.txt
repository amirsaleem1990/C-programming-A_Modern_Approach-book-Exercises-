82 Chapter5  Selection Statements

The cascaded i£ statement could have been written this way instead (the
changes are indicated in bold):

if (value < 2500.00f)
commission = 30.00£ + .017f * value;

else if (value >= 2500.00f && value < 6250.00£f)
commission = 56.00f + .0066f * value;

else if (value >= 6250.00£ && value < 20000.00£)
commission = 76.00£ + .0034£ * value;

Although the program will still work, the added conditions aren’t necessary. For
example, the first à £ clause tests whether value is less than 2500 and, if so. com-
putes the commission. When we reach the second i £ test (Value >= 2500.00f
&& value < 6250.00f), we know that value can’t be less than 2500 and
therefore must be greater than or equal to 2500. The condition value >=
2500 .00£ will always be true, so there's no point in checking it.

 

This example illustrates the value of braces; if we’d used them in the original i f
statement, we wouldn’t have gotten into this situation 1n the first place.
