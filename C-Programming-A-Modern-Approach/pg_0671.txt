*C99 only

Table 25.4 explains the meaning of the values of the p_sep_by space.
n _sep by space, int_p_sep by _ space, and int _n sep by space
members. The meaning of p_sep _ by _ space and n sep by space has

changed in C99. In C89, there are only two possible values for these members: |

(if there’s a space between currency _ symbol and a monetary quantity) or O (if

there’s not).

 

 

 

Value Meaning
0 No space separates currency symbol and quantity.
1 If currency symbol and sign are adjacent, à space separates them from
quantity; otherwise, a space separates currency symbol from quantity.
2 If currency symbol and sign are adjacent, a spacè separates them:
otherwise, a space separates sign from quantity.

 

 

Table 25.5 explains the meaning of the values of the p sign posn,

n sign posn,int p _sign posnand iint n sign posn members.

 

 

 

Value Meaning
0 Parentheses surround quantity and currency symbol
1 Sign precedes quantity and currency symbol
2 Sign succeeds quantity and currency symbol
3 Sign immediately precedes currency symbol
4 Sign immediately succeeds currency symbol

 

 

To see how the members of the 1conv structure might vary from one locale to

another, let’s look at two examples. Table 25.6 shows typical values of the monetary
1conv members for the U.S.A. and Finland (which uses the euro as its currency).
