76 Chapter5  Selection Statements

u exprl | | expr2 hasthe value | if either expr/ or expr2 (or both) has a nonzero
value.

In all other cases, these operators produce the value 0.
Both && and | | perform “short-circuit” evaluation of their operands. That is,

 

 

Î Be wary of side effects in logical expressions. Thanks to the short-circuit nature of
the && and | | operators, side effects in operands may not always occur. Consider
the following expression:

i > O && +j > O

Although 3 1s apparently incremented as a side effect of evaluating the expression,
that isn’t always the case. If i > O is false, then ++j > O is not evaluated, so j isn’t
incremented. The problem can be fixed by changing the condition to ++j > O &&
i > O or, even better, by incrementing j separately.

 

 

5.2 The i£f Statement

The i £ statement allows a program to choose between two alternatives by testing
the value of an expression. In its simplest form, the i £ statement has the form

i £ statement 1f ( expression ) statement

Notice that the parentheses around the expression are mandatory; they’re part of
the 1 £ statement, not part of the expression. Also note that the word then doesn't
come after the parentheses, as it would in some programming languages.
