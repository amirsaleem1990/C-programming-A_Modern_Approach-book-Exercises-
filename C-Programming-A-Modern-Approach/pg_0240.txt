(b) void £ (double) ;
(c) void £(x) ;
(d) f (double x) ;

What will be the output of the following program?

#include <stdio.h>
void swap(int a, int b);

int main (void)

{

int i = 1, j = 2;

swap(i, j) ;
printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, J);
return 0;

}

void swap(int a, int b)

ï

int temp = àa;
a = b;
b = temp;

}

Write functions that return the following values. (Assume that à and n are parameters,
where a is an array of int values and n is the length of the array.)

(a) The largest element in a.
(b) The average of all elements in a.
(c) The number of positive elements in a.

Write the following function:
float compute_GPA(char grades[], int n);

The grades array will contain letter grades (A, B, C. D, or F, either upper-case or lower-
case); n is the length of the array. The funetion should return the average of the grades
(assume that A = 4, B= 3,C=2,D=1,and F =0).

Write the following function:

double inner product (double a[], double b[], int n);
The function should return a [(0] * b [0] +a [[1] #* b{[1] + … +a [n-1] * b[n-1).

Write the following function, which evaluates à chess position:
int evaluate position(char board[8] [8]) ;

board represents à configuration of pieces on a chessboard, where the letters K, Q, R, B, N,
P represent White pieces, and the letters k. q. r, b, n. and p represent Black pieces.
evaluate position should sum the values of the White pieces (Q = 9,R = 5, B = 3,
N = 3, P = |). Lt should also sum the values of the Black pièces (done in a similar way). The
function will return the difference betwcen the two numbers. This value will be positive if
White has an advantage in material and negative if Black has an advantage.

Thc following function is supposed to return true if any element of the array a has the
value 0 and false if all clements are nonzero. Sadly, it contains an error. Find the error and
show how to fix it:
