The <wctype.h> Header (C99)
Wide-Character Classification and Mapping Utilities

The <wctype.h> header is the wide-character version of the <ctype.h>
header. <ctype.h> provides two kinds of functions: character-classification
functions (like isdigit, which tests whether a character is a digit) and character
case-mapping functions (like toupper, which converts a lower-case letter to
upper case). <wctype.h> provides similar functions for wide characters.
although it differs from <ctype .h> in one important way: some of the functions
in <wctype .h> are ““extensible”’ meaning that they can perform custom charac-
ter classification or case mappineg.

<wctype .h> declares three types and a macro. The wint_ t type and the
WEOF macro were discussed in Section 25.5. The remaining types are wctype _t,
whose values represent locale-specific character classifications, and wctrans t,
whose values represent locale-specific character mappings.

Most of the functions in <wctype .h> require a wint t argument. The
value of this argument must be a wide character (a wchar t valuëe) or WEOF.
Passing any other argument causes undefined behavior.

The behavior of the functions in <wctype .h> is affected by the LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.

Each wide-character classification function returns a nonzero value if its argument
has a particular property. Table 25.19 lists the property that each function tests.
The descriptions in Table 25.19 1gnore some of the subtleties of wide charac-
ters. For example, the definition of iswgraph in the C99 standard states that it
“tests for any wide character for which iswprint 1s true and iswspace is false,”
