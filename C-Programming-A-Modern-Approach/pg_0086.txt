program will still compile. Unfortunately, the latter expression is equivalent to
i = (+), which merely copies the value of  into i.

 

 

4.3 Increment and Decrement Operators

Two of the most common operations on a variable are ‘“incrementing” (adding 1)

and “decrementing” (subtracting 1). We can, of course, accomplish these tasks by
writing

At first glance, the increment and decrement operators are simplicity itself: ++
adds | to its operand, whereas - - subtracts |. Unfortunately, this simplicity 1S mis-
leading—the increment and decrement operators can be tricky to use. One compli-
cation is that ++ and -- can be used as prefix operators (++i and --i, for
example) or postfix operators (i++ and i--). The correctness of a program may
hinge on picking the proper version.
