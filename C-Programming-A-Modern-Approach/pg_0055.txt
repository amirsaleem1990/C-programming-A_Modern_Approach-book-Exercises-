30 Chapter2 C Fundamentals

Q:
A:

Q: Why is C so terse? It seems as though programs would be more readable if C
used begin and end instead of { and }, integer instead of int, and so
forth. [p. 12]

A:  Legend has it that the brevity of C programs 1s due to the environment that existed
in Bell Labs at the time the language was developed. The first C compiler ran on a
DEC PDP-11 (an early minicomputer); programmers used a teletype—essentially
a typewriter connected to a computer—to enter programs and print listings.
Because teletypes were very slow (they could print only 10 characters per second).
minimizing the number of characters in a program was clearly advantageous.
