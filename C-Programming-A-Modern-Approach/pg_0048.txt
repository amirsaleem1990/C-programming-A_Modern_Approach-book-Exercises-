/* Computes the dimensional weight of a
box from input provided by the user */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

!

int height, length, width, volume, weight ;

print£ ("Enter height of box: ");
scanf ("$d", &height) ;

print£f ("Enter length of box: ") ;
scanf ("%d", &length) ;

printf ("Enter width of box: ");
scanf ("%*d", &width) ;

volume = height * length * width;
weight = (volume + 165) / 166;

The output of the program has the following appearance (input entered by the user
is underlined):

Enter height of box:
Enter length of box: 12
Enter width of box: 10

Volume (cubic inches): 960
Dimensional weight (pounds) : 6

À message that asks the user to enter input (a prompt) normally shouldn’t end with
a new-line character, because we want the user to enter input on the same line as
the prompt itself. When the user presses the Enter key, the cursor automatically
moves to the next line—the program doesn't need to display a new-line character
to terminate the current line.

The dweight2 .c program suffers from one problem: it doesn't work cor-
rectly if the user enters nonnumeric input. Section 3.2 discusses this issue in more
detail.
