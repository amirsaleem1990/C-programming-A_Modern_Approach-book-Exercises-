The newer comment style has a couple of important advantages. First, because a
comment automatically ends at the end of a line, there’s no chance that an untermi-
nated comment will accidentally consumepart of a program. Second, multiline
comments stand out better, thanks to the // that’s required at the beginning of
each line.

Variables and Assignment

Few programs are as simple as the one in Section 2.1. Most programs need to per-
form a series of calculations before producing output, and thus need a way to store
data temporarily during program execution. In C, as in most programming lan-
ouages, these storage locations are called variables.

Types

Every väriable must have a fype, which specifies what kind of data it will hold. C
has a wide variety of types. For now, we’Il limit ourselves to just two: int and
float. Choosing the proper type is critical, since the type affects how the variable
is stored and what operations can be performed on the variable. The type of a

 

 

Declarations

Variables must be declared—described for the benefit of the compiler—before
they can Le used. To declare a variable, we first specify the rype of the variable,
then its name. (Variable names are chosen by the programmer. subject to the rules
described in Section 2.7.) For example, we might declare variables height and
profit as follows:

int height ;
float profit;
