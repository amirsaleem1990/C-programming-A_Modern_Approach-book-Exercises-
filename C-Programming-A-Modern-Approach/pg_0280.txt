p = &j; /*** WRONG ***/

Exercises

If à is a variable and p points to i, which of the following expressions are aliases for i ?

(a) *p (c) *&p (e) #i (g) *&i
(b) &p (d) &*p (f) &i (h) &*i

If à is an int variable and p and q are pointers to int, which of the following assignments
are legal?

(a) p = i; (d) p = &g; (g) p = *q;
(b) *p = &i; (e) p = *&g; (h) *p = ;
(c) & = ; (f) p = q: (1) *p = *g;

The following function supposedly computes the sum and average of the numbers in the
array a. which has length n. avg and sum point to variables that the function should mod-
ify. Unfortunately, the function contains several errors; find and correct them.

void avg_sum(double a[], int n, double *avg, double *sum)

(

int i;

sum = 0.0;

for (i = O0; i < n; i++)

sum += a[i];

avg = sum / n;
Write the following function:
void swap(int *p, int *g);
When passed the addresses of two variables, swap should exchange the values of the vari-
ables:

swap(&i, &]) ; /* exchanges values of i and ; */

Write the following function:
void split time(long total _ sec, int *hr, int *min, int *sec);

total_sec is a time represented as the number of seconds since midnight. hr, min, and
sec are pointers to variables in which the function will store the equivalent time in hours
(0-23), minutes (0-59). and seconds (0-59), respectively.

Write the following function:

void find _ two _largest (int a[], int n, int *largest,
int *second largest) ;
