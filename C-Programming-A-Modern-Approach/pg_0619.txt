(“domain error”) is stored in errno. In some implementations of
<math.h>, functions return a special value known as NaN (‘“‘not a number”)
when a domain error occurs.

« Range error: The return value of a function is outside the range of double
values. If the return value’s magnitude is too large (overflow), the function
relurns positive or negative HUGE_VAL, depending on the sign of the correct
result. In addition, ERANGE (‘‘range error”) is stored in errno. If the return
value’s magnitude is too small to represent (underflow), the function returns
Zero; some implementations may also store ERANGE in errno.

We'll ignore the possibility of error for the remainder of this section. How-
ever, the function descriptions in Appendix D explain the circumstances that lead
to each type of error.

Trigonometric Functions

double acos (double x) ;

double asin (double x) ;

double atan (double x) ;

double atan2 (double y, double x) ;
double cos (double x) ;

double sin(double x) ;

double tan(double x) ;

The cos, sin, and tan functions compute the cosine, sine, and tangent, respec-
tively. If PI is defined to be 3.14159265, passing PI/4 to cos, sin, and tan
produces the following results:

cos (PI/4) => 0.707107
sin(PI/4) => 0.707107
tan (PI/4) => 1.0

Note that arguments to cos, sin, and tan are expressed in radians, not degrees.
acos, asin, and atan compute the arc cosine, arc sine, and arc tangent:

acos(1.0) => 0.0
asin(1.0) = 11.5708
atan(1.0) =— 0.785398

Applying acos to a value returned by cos won’t necessarily yield the original
argument to cos, since acos always returns a value between 0 and . asin and
atan return a value between —x/2 and 7/2.

atan2 computes the arc tangent of y/x, where y is the function’s first argu-
ment and x is its second. The return value of atan2 is between — and x. The call
atan (x) is equivalent to atan2 (x, 1.0).
