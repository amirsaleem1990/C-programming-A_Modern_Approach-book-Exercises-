a value, 1t Can be used to help compute (ne

height B;

length-= 12;

width = 10;

volume = height * length * width; /* volume is now 960 */

In C. * represents the multiplication operator, so this statement multiplies the val-
ues stored in height, length. and width, then assigns the result to the vari-
able volume. In general, the right side of an assignment can be a formula (or
expression, in C terminology) involving constants, variables, and operators.

Printing the Value of a Variable

We can use printf to display the current value of a variable. For example, to

Height : ñ

where / is the current value of the height variable. we'd use the following call of
