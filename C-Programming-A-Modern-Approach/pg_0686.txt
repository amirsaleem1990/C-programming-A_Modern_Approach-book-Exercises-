Wide-Character Input/

Equivalents

 

25.5 The <wchar.h> Header (C99) 661

swprintf returns a negative value if the number of wide characters to be written
is n or more, which differs from the behavior of both sprint f and snprintf.
vswprintf is equivalent tà swprint£, with arg replacing the variable
argument list of swprint£. Like swprint£, which 1s similar—but not identi-
cal—to sprintf and snprintf, the vswprintf function is a combination of
vsprint£ and vsnprint£Ë. If an attempt is made to write n or more wide char-
acters, vswprint £ returns a negative integer, In a manner similar to swprintéË.

Wide-Character Input/Output Functions

wint t fgetwc (FILE *stream) ;
wchar t *fgetws(wchar t * restrict s, int n,
FILE * restrict stream) ;

wint t fputwc(wchar t c, FILE *stream) ;

int fputws (const wchar t * restrict s,
FILE * restrict stream) ;

int fwide (FILE *stream, int mode) ;

wint & getwc (FILE *stream) ;

wint t getwchar (void) ;

wint t putwc(wchar t c, FILE *stream) ;

wint t putwchar(wchar t c);

wint t ungetwc(wint _ t c, FILE *stream) ;

The functions in this group are wide-character versions of the character inpul/out-
put functions found in <stdio.h> and described in Section 22.4. Table 25.12
shows the correspondence between the <stdio.h> functions and their wide-
character counterparts. Às the table shows, £wide 1s the only truly new function.

Unless otherwise indicated, you can assume that each <wchar.h> function
listed in Table 25.12 behaves like the correspondine <stdio.h> function. How-
ever, one minor difference is common to most of these functions. To indicate an
error or end-of-file condition, some <stdio.h> character VO functions return
EOF. The equivalent <wchar .h> f'unctions return WEOF instead.
