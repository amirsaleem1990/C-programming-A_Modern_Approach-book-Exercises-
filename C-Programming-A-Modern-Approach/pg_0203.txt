Using the shorteuts described in Section 8.2, shrink the initializer for the segments array
(Exercise 6) as much as you can.

Write a declaration for a two-dimensional array named temperature readings that
stores one month of hourly temperature readings. (For simplicity. assume that a month has
30 days.) The rows of the array should represent days of the month; the columns should rep-
resent hours of the day.

Using the array of Exercise 8. write a program fragment that computes the average tempera-
ture for a month (averaged over all days of the month and all hours of the day).

Write à declaration for an 8 x 8 char array named chess _board. Include an initializer
that puts the following data into the array (one character per array clement):

r nbgqkbnr
PPPPPPPP

PPPPPPPP
RNBOQOKBNR
Write à program fragment that declares an 8 x 8 char array named checker board and
then uses a loop to store the l'ollowing data into the array (one character per array element):

BRBRBRBR
RBRBRBRB
BRBRBRBR
RBRBRBRB
BRBRBRBR
RBRBRBRRB
BRBRBRBR
RBRBRERB

Hint: The element in row /, column j, should be the letter B if / + / is an even number.

Programming Projects

Modify the repdigit .c program of Section 8.1 so that it shows which digits (if any)
were repeated:

Enter a number: 939577
Repeated digit (s): 7 9

Modify the repdigit .c program of Section 8.1 so that it prints à table showing how
many times each digit appears in the number:

Enter a number: 41271092
Digit : 0 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 89
Occurrences : 1. 2 2 01000101

Modify the repdigit .c program of Section 8.1 so that the user can enter more than one
number to be tested l'or repeated digits. The program should terminate when the user enters
a number thats less than or equal to 0.
