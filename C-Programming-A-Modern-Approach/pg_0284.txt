Subtracting an Integer from a Pointer

If p points to the array element a [i]. then p - j points to a [i-j] . For example:

p = &a[8]; pï_l

Subtracting One Pointer from Another

When one pointer is subtracted from another, the result is the distance (measured
in array elements) between the pointers. Thus, if p points to a [i] and q points to
a [j1.then p - q is equal to i - j. For example:
