 

23.5  The <ctype.h> Header: Character Handling 613

Each character-classification function returns a nonzero value if its argument has a
particular property. Table 23.10 lists the property that each function tests.

 

 

 

 

Table 23.10 Function Test
Character—Classilîca}ion isalnum(c) [Is c alphanumeric?
Functions isalpha (c) Is c alphabetic?
isblank (c) Is c a blank ?
iscntrl (c) Is c a control character?**
isdigit (c) 1s c a decimal digit?
isgraph(c) Is c a printing character (other than a space)?
islower (c) Is c a lower-case letter?
isprint (c) Is € à printing character (including a space)?
ispunct (c) Is c punetuation ?***
isspace (c) Is c a white-space character?****
isupper (c) [s c an upper-case letter’
isxdigit(c) Is cahexadecimal digit?

 

“The standard blank characters are space and horizontal tab (\t). This
function is new in C99.

n ASCII, the control characters are \x00 through \x1£ plus \x 7£.
TT AN printing characters except those for which isspace or isalnum
are true are considcred punctuation.

TtTre White-space characters are space. form fced (\ £), new-line (\n).
carriage return (\r), horizontal tab (\t), and vertical tab (\v).

@ The C99 definition of ispunct is slishtly different than the one in C89. In
C89, ispunct (c) tests whether c is à printing character but not a space or a
character for which isalnum(c) is true. In C99, ispunct (c) tests whether
C is a printing character for which neither isspace (c) nor isalnum(c) is
true.

PROGRAM  Testing the Character-Classification Functions

The following program demonstrates the character-classification functions (with
the exception of isblank, which is new in C99) by applying them to the charac-
ters in the string "azAZO !\t".

iclassify.c /* Tests the character-classification functions */

#Hinclude <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>

Hdefine TEST(£) printf(" %c ", £(*p) ? 'x' : " !)
int main (void)
{
char *p;
printf (" alnum cntrl graph print"
!" space xdigit\n"
" alpha digit lower punct "

"l upper\nn ) ;
