390 Chapter 16 Structures, Unions, and Enumerations

We'll use the codes i (insert). s (search), u (update). p (print). and q (quit) to rep-
resent thesc operations. À session with the program might look like this:

Enter onperation code: i
Enter part number: 528
Enter part name: Disk drive
Enter quantity on hand: 10

 

Enter operation code: s
Enter part number: 528
Part name: Disk drive
Quantity on hand: 10

Enter operation code: s
Enter part number: 914
Part not É£ouna.

Enter operation code: i
Enter part number: 914

Enter part name: Printer cable
Enter quantity on hand: S

 

 

Enter operation code: u

Enter part number: 528

Enter change in quantity on hand: -2
Enter operation code: s

Enter part number: 528

Part name: Disk drive

Quantity on hand: 8

Enter operation code: p

Enter operation code: q

The program will store information about cach part in à structure. We"ll limit
the size of tfhe database to 100 parts. making it possible to store the structures in an
array, which l’Il call inventory. (If this limit proves to be too small, we can
always change it latér.) To kcep track of the number of parts currently stored In the
array, we ll use à vartable named num parts.

Since this program is menu-driven, it’s fairly casy to sketch the main loop:

Eor (;;) |

prompt user to enter operation code ;

read code ;

switch (code) |
case ‘i': perform insert operation; break;
case ‘'s': perform search operation; break;
case ‘'u': perform update operation; break;
case ‘p': perform print operation; break;
