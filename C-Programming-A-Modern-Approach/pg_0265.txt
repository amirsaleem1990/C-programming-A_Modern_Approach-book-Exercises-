Chapter 10 Program Organization

the number contains more than this number of digits. the extra digits are ignored. Hints: Usce
two external arrays. One is the segments array (see Exercise 6 in Chapter 8), which stores
data representing the correspondence between digits and segments. The other array. dig-
its, will be an array of characters with 4 rows (since each segmented digit is four charac-
ters high) and MAX DIGITS * 4 columns (digits are three characters wide, but a space 1s
needed between digits for readability). Write your program as four functions: main,
clear _digits array. process _ digit, and print digits array. Here are
the prototypes for the latter three functions:

void clear digits _array (void) ;
void process digit (int digit, int position) ;
void print digits _ array (void) ;

clear_digits array vwill store blank characters into all elements of the digits
array, process digit will store the seven-segment representation of digit into a
specified position in the digits array (positions range from O to MAX DIGITS â€” |).
print_digits _array will display the rows of the digits array. each on a single line,
producing output such as that shown in the example.
