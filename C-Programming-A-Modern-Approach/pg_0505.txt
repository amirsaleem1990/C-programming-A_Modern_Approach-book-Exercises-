Let £ be the following f'unction. What will be the value of £ (10) 1f £ has never been called
before? What will be the value of £ (10) 1f £ has been called Live times previously?

int f(int i)
static int y = O;
return i * j++;

}

State whether each of the following statements is true or faise. Justify cach answer.
(a) Every variable with static storage duration has file scope.

(b) Every variable declared inside à function has no linkage.

(c) Every variable with internal linkage has static storage duration.

(d) Every parameter has block scope.

The following function is supposed to print an error message. Each message is prececled by
an integer, indicating the number of times the function has been called. Unfortunately. the
function always displays ! as the number of the error message. [Locate the error and show
how to fix it without making any changes outside the function.

void print error(const char *message)

{

int n = 1;
print£f ("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message) ;

}

Suppose that we declare x to be a const object. Which one of the following statements
about x 1s false”

(a) If x is of type int, it can be used as the value of a case label in a switch statement.
(b) The compiler will check that no assignment is made to x.

(c) x is subject to the same scope rules as variables.,

(d) x can be of any type.

Write a complete description of the type of x as specified by each of the following declara-
tions.

(a) char (*x[10]) (int) ;

(b) int (*x(int)) [5] ;

(c) float * (*x(void) ) (int) ;

(d) void (*x(int, void (*y) (int))) (int) ;

Use à series of type definitions to simplify each of the declarations in Exercise 8.

Write declarations for the following variables and functions:

(a) p is a pointer to u function with a character pointer argument that returns a character
pointer.
