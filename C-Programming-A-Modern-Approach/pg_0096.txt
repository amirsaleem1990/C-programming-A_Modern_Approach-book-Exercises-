(a) a * b - C * d + e
(b) a / b % c / d

(c) - a- b + C - + d
(d)a * - b / c - d

Give the values of i and j after cach of the following expression statements has been exe-
cuted. (Assume that à has the value 1 initially and j has the value 2.)

(a) i += j;
(b) i--;

(c) à * j / i;
(d) i % ++];

Programming Projects

Write a program that asks the user to enter à two-digit number, then prints the number with
its digits reversed. À session with the program should have the following appearance:

Enter a two-digit number: 28
The reversal is: 82

Read the number using %d, then break it into two digits. Æinr: IFn 1s an integer, then n % 10
is the last digit in n and n / 10 is n with the last digit removed.

Extend the program in Programming Project ! to handle (/ree-digit numbers.

Rewrite the program in Programming Project 2 so that it prints the reversal of a three-digit
number without using arithmetic to split the number into digits. Hinr: See the upc .c pro-
gram of Section 4.1.

Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and displays it in octal (base 8):

Enter a number between 0 and 32767: 1953

‘In octal, your number is: 03641

The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer digits are sufficient. Hint: To
convert the number to octal, first divide it by 8; the remainder is the last digit of the octal
number (1, in this case). Then divide the original number by & and repeat the process to
arrive at the next-to-last disit. (printf£ is capable of displaying numbers in base 8, as we Il
see in Chapter 7, so there’s actually an easier way to write this program.)

Rewrite the upc.c program of Section 4.1 so that the user enters ! | digits at one time,
instead of entering one digilt. then five digits, and then another five digits.

Enter the first 11 digits of a UPC: 01380015173
Check digit: S

 

European countries use a I3-digit code, known as a European Article Number (EAN)
instead of the 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC) found in North America. Each EAN
ends with a check digit, just as a UPC does. The technique for calculating the check digit 1s
also similar:

Add the second, fourth. sixth, cighth, tenth. and twelfth digits.

Add the first, third. fifth. seventh, ninth, and eleventh digits.

Multiply the first sum by 3 and add it to the second sum.
