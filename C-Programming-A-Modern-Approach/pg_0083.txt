58 Chapter4  Expressions

first_sum = d + i2 + i4 + j1 + j3 + j5;
second_sum = il + i3 + i5 + j2 + j4;
total = 3 * first sum + second _sum;

print£ ("Check digit: %d\n", 9 - ((total - 1) % 10));

return 0;

Note that the expression 9 - ( (total - 1) % 10) could have been written
as 9 - (total - 1) % 10, but the extra set of parentheses makes it easier to
understand.

4.2 Assignment Operators

Once the value of an expression has been computed, we*I1 often need to store it in
a variable for later use. C's = (simple assignment) operator is used for that pur-
pose. For updating a value already stored in a variable, C provides an assortment of
compound assignment operators.

Simple Assignment

The effect of the assignment v = e is to evaluate the expression e and copy its value
into v. Às the following examples show, e can bc a constant. a variable, or a more
complicated expression:

5 ; /* i is now 5 */
j = i; /* j is now 5 */
k = 10 * i + j; /* k is now 55 */

i
