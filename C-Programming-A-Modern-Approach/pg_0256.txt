10.5  Organizing a C Program 231

a poker hand. Each card in the hand will have both à su (clubs. diamonds, hearts,
or spades) and a rank (two. three. four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen.
king, or ace). We won'1 allow the use of jokers. and we’ll assume that aces are
high. The program will read a hand of five cards. then classify the hand into one of
the following categories (listed in order from best to worst):

straight flush (both à straight and a flush)
four-of-a-kind (four cards of the same rank)
fuil house (a three-of-a-kind and a pair)

flush (five cards of the same suit)

straight (five cards with consecutive ranks)
three-of-a-kind (three cards of the same rank)
LwoO pairs

pair ({wo cards of the same rank)

high card (any other hand)

If a hand falls into two or more categories, the program will choose the best onc.
For input purposes, we'Il abbreviate ranks and suits as follows (letters may be
either upper- or lower-case):

Ranks: 2 3 45 6789t7gka
Suits: c d h s

If the user enters an illegal card or tries to enter the same card twice, the program
will ignore the card, issue an error message, and then request another card. Enter-
ing the number 0 instead of à card will cause the program to terminate.
