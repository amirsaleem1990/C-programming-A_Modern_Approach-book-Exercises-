72 Chapter4  Expressions

Subtract 1 from the total.
Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 9.

For example, consider Güllüoglu Turkish Delight Pistachio & Coconut, which has an EAN
of 8691484260008. The first sum is6+1+8+2+0+0= 7, and the second sum is 8 + 9 +
4+4+6+0=31.Multiplying the first sum by 3 and adding the second yields 82. Subtraet-
ing | gives 81. The remainder upon dividing by 10 is 1. When the remainder is subtracted
from 9, the result is 8, which matches the last digit of the original code. Your job is to mod-
ify the upc .c program of Section 4.1 so that it caleulates the check digit for an EAN. The
user will enter the first 12 digits of the EAN as a single number:
