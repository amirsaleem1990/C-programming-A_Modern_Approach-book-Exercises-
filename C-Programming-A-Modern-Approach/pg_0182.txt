Assume that à program contains the following declarations:

char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3;

long m = 5;
float £ = 6.5ËÉ;
double d = 7.5;

Give the value and the type of each expression listed below.

(a) c * i (c) £ / € (e) £ - d
(b) Ss + m (d) d / s (F) (int) £

Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of £ correctty (assuming
that £ and frac_part are float variables)”?

frac _ part = £ - (int) f;

If not, what's the problem”

Use typedef to create types named Int8, Int16. und Int32. Define the types so that
they represent 8-bit, 16-bit. and 32-bit intégers on your machine.

The square2. c program of Section 6.3 will fail (usually by printing strange answers) if
i * i exceeds the maximum int value. Run the program and determine the smallest value
of n that causes failure. Try changing the type of i to short and running the progräm
again. (Don’t forget to update the conversion specifications in the call of print£!) Then
try lJong. From these experiments. what can you conclude about the number of bits used Lo
storc integer types on your machine?

Modify the square2 . c program of Section 6.3 so that it pauses after every 24 squares and
displays the following message:

Press Enter to continue...

After displaying the message, the program should use getchar to read a character.
getchar won't allow the program to continue unuil thèe user presses the Enter key.

Modify the sum2 . c program of Section 7.1 to sum a series of double values.

Write a program that translates an alphabetic phone number into numerie form:

Enter phone number: CALLATT
2255288

(In case you don't have a tclephone nearby. here are the letters on the keys: 2=ABC, 3=DEF,
4=GHT, 5=JKL, 6=MNO, 7=PRS, 8=TUV. 9=WXY.) If the original phone number contains
nonalphabetic characters (digits Or punctuation, for example), leave them unchanged:

Enter phone number: 1-800-COL-LECT
1-800-265-5328

 

You may assume that any letters entered by the user are upper case.
