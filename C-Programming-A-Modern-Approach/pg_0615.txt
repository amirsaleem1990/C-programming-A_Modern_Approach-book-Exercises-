Unlike the other macros in <float .h>, which represent constant expressions,
the value of FLT ROUNDS may change during execution. (The fesetround
function allows a program to change the current rounding direction.) The other
macro, FLT RADIX, specifies the radix of exponent representation; it has a mini-
mum value of 2 (indicating binary representation).

The remaining macros, which TIl present in a series of tables, describe the
characteristics of specific types. Each macro begins with either FLT. DBL, or
LDBL, depending on whether it refers to the £loat, double, or long double
type. The C standard provides extremely detailed definitions of these macros; my
descriptions will be less precise but easier to understand. The tables indicate maxi-
mum or minimum values for some macros, as specified in the standard.

Table 23.2 lists macros that define the number of significant digits guaranteed
by each floating type.

 

 

 

 

 

Name Value Description
FLT MANT DIG Number of significant digits (base FLT _ RADIX)
DBL MANT DIG
LDBL MANT DIG
FLT DIG 26 Number of significant digits (base 10)
DBL DIG >10
LDBL DIG >10

 

Table 23.3 lists macros having to do with exponents.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Name Valne Description
FLT MIN EXP Smallest (most negative) power to which
DBL MIN EXP FLT RADIX can be raised
LDBL MIN EXP
FLT MIN 10 EXP 537 _ Smallest (most negative) power to which 10 can be
DBL MIN 10 EXP <—37 _ raised
LDBL MIN 10 EXP — <37
FLT MAX EXP Largest power to which FLT RADIX can be raised
DBL MAX EXP
LDBL MAX EXP
FLT MAX 10 EXP 2+37 _ Largest power to which 10 can be raised
DBL MAX 10 EXP —… >+37
LDBL MAX 10 EXP — 2+37

 

Table 23.4 lists macros that describe how large numbers can be, how close to
zero they can get, and how close two consecutive numbers can be.
