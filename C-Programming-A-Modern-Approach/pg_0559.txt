C99 Library Changes

Some of the biggest changes in C99 affect the standard library. These changes fall
into three groups:

u Additional headers. The C99 standard library has nine headers that don°t exist
in C89. Three of these (csiso646.h>, <wchar.h>. and <wctype.h>)
were actually added to C in 1995 when the C89 standard was amended. The
other six (<ccomplex.h>, <fenv.h>., <inttypes.h>, <stdbool.h».
<stdint .h>, and <tgmath.h>)are new in C99.

wm Additional macros and functions. The C99 standard adds macros and fune-
tions to several existing headers, primarily <float.h>, <math.h>. and
<stdio.h>. The additions to the <math.h> header are so extensive that
they’re covered in à separate section (Section 23.4).

# Enhanced versions of existing functions. Some existing functions, including
print£ and scan£. have additional capabilities in C99.

We'1l now take a quick look at the nine additional headers in the C99 standard
library, just as we did in Section 21.2 for the headers in the C89 library.

Complex Arithmetic

Defines the complex and I macros, which are useful when working with com-
plex numbers. Also provides functions for performing mathematical operations on
complex numbers.

Floating-Point Environment

Provides access to floating-point status flags and control modes. For example, a
program might test a flag to see if overflow occurred during a floating-point opera-
tion or set a control mode to specify how rounding should be done.

Format Conversion of Integer Types

Defines macros that can be used in format strings for input/output of the integer
types declared in <stdint .h>. Also provides functions for working with great-
est-width integers.

Alternative Spellings

Defines macros that represent certain operators (the ones containing the characters
& |, —, !, and “). These macros are useful for writing programs in an environment
where these characters might not be part of the local character set.
