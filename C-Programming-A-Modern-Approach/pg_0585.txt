…scanf Functions

Input/Output

For example, the format string "ISBN %d-%d-%1d-%d" specifies that the
Input will consist of:

the letters ISBN

possibly some white-space characters

an integer

the - character

an integer (possibly preceded by white-space characters)

the - character

a long integer (possibly preceded by white-space characters)

the - character

an integer (possibly preceded by white-space characters)

…scan£f Conversion Specifications

Conversion specifications for ….scan£ functions are actually à little simpler than
those for ….print£ functions. À …scan£ conversion specification consists of the
character % followed by the items listed below (in the order shown).
m * (optional). The presence of * signifies assigmment suppression: an input
item is read but not assigned to an object. llems matched using # aren°
included in the count that …scan£ returns.

= Maximuim field width (optional). The maximum field width limits the number
of characters in an input item: conversion of the item ends if this number is
reached. White-space characters skipped at the beginning of a conversion
don’t count.

#s Length modifier (optional). The presence of à length modifier indicates that the
object in which the input item will be stored has à type that’s longer or shorter
than is normal for a particular conversion specification. Table 22.11 lists each
length modifier, the conversion specifiers with which it may be used. and the
type indicated by the combination of the two. (Any combination of length mod-
ifier and conversion specifier not shown in the table causes undefined behavior.)
