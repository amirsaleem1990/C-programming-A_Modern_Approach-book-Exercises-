tasks, including user-interface development, graphics, communications. data-
base management, and networking, are readily available. Some libraries are in
the public domain, some are open source, and some are sold commercially.

 

—Thc programming examples in this book follow one set of

conventions, but there are other, equally valid, conventions in use. (We*Il dis-
cuss some of the alternatives from time to time.) Which set you use 1s less

u Sfick to the standard. Most C compilers provide language features and library
functions that aren’t part of the C89 or C99 standards. For portability. il's best
to avoid using nonstandard features and libraries unless they’re absolutely
necessary.

Q & À

What is this Q& À section anyway?

Glad you asked. The Q&AÀ section. which appears at the end of each chapter,
serves several purposes.

The primary purpose of Q&A 1s to tackle questions that are frequently asked
by students learning C. Readers can participate in a dialogue (more or less) with
the author, much the same as 1f they were attending one of my C classes.

Another purpose of Q&A 1s to provide additional information about topics
covered in the chapter. Readers of this book will likely have widely varying back-
grounds. Some will be experienced in other programming languages, whercas oth-
ers will be lcarning to program for the first time. Rcaders with experience in a
variety of languages may be satisfied with a brief explanation and a couple of
examples, but readers with less experience may need more. The bottom line: LF you
find the coverage of a topic to be sketchy, check Q&A for more details.

On occasion, Q&AÀ will discuss common differences among C compilers. For
example, we'll cover some frequently used (but nonstandard) features that are pro-
vided by particular compilers.
