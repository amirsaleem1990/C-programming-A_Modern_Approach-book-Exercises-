What output do the following calls of printf produce?

(a) printf("%6d,%4d", 86, 1040) ;
(b) print£f("%12.5e", 30.253) ;

(c) printf("%.4f£", 83.162) ;

(d) printf("%-6.2g", .0000009979) ;

Write calls of printf that display a float variable x in the following formats.

(a) Exponential notation; left-justified in à field of size 8: one digit after the decimal point.

(b) Exponential notation: right-justified in a field of size 10: six digits after the decimal
point.

(c) Fixed decimal notation: left-justified in à field of size 8: three digits after the decimal
point.

(d) Fixed decimal notation; right-justified in à field of size 6: no digits after the decimal
point.

For each of the following pairs of scanf format strings, indicate whether or not the two
strings arc equivalent. If they*re not, show how they can be distinguished.

(u) "Zd" versus " %d"

(b) "%Sd-%$d-%d" versus "%=d -%d -%d"
(c) "Sf" versus "%£ "

(d) "Sf,=f" versus "S£, %f"

Suppose that we call scan£ as follows:
scanf ("$d%f%d", &i, &Xx, &]);
If the user enters

10.3 5 6

what will be the values of i, x, and j after the call? (Assume that i and j are int variables
and x is a float variable.)

Suppose that we call scan£ as follows:

scanf ("%f%d%£{", &x, &i, &y) ;

If the user enters

12.3 45.6 789

what will be the values of x, i. and y after the call? (Assume that x and y are float vari-

ables and i is an int variable.)

Show how to modify the addfrac. c program of Section 3.2 so that the user is allowed to
enter fractions that contain spaces before and after each / character.

 

*Starred exercises are tricky—the correct answer is usually not the obvious one, Read the question
thoroughly, review the relevant section if necessary, and be careful!
