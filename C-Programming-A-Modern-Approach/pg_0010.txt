Preface

Acknowledgments

First, P’d like to thank my editors at Norton, Fred McFarland and Aaron Javsicas.
Fred got the second edition underway and Aaron stepped in with brisk efficiency to
bring it to completion. l’d also like to thank associate managing editor Kim Yi, copy
editor Mary Kelly, production manager Roy Tedoff, and editorial assistant Carly
Fraser.

1 owe a huge debt to the following colleagues, who reviewed some or all of the
manuscript for the second edition:

Markus Bussmann, University of Toronto

Jim Clarke, University of Toronto

Karen Reid, University of Toronto

Peter Seebach, moderator of comp.lang.c.moderated

Jim and Peter deserve special mention for their detailed reviews, which saved me
from a number of embarrassing stips. The reviewers for the first edition, in alpha-
betical order, were: Susan Anderson-Freed, Manuel E. Bermudez, Lisa J. Brown,
Steven C. Cater, Patrick Harrison, Brian Harvey, Henry H. Leitner, Darrell Long.
Arthur B. Maccabe. Carolyn Rosner. and Patrick Terry.

I received many useful comments from readers of the first edition; T thank
everyone who took the time to write. Students and collcagues at Georgia State Uni-
versity also provided valuable feedback. Ed Bullwinkel and his wife Nancy were
kind enough to read much of the manuscript. l’m particularly grateful to my depart-
ment chair, Yi Pan, who was very supportive of the project.

My wife, Susan Cole, was a pitlar of strength as always. Our cats, Dennis,
Pounce, and Tex, were also instrumental in the completion of the book. Pounce and
Tex were happy to contribute the occasional catfight to help keep me awake while
| was working late at night.

Finally, l’d like to acknowledge the late Alan J. Perlis, whose epigrams appear
at the beginning of each chapter. ! had the privilege of studying briefly under Alan
at Yale in the mid-70s. T think he'd be amused at finding his epigrams in a C book.
